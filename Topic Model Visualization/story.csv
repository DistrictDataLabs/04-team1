"1","'Brain Prize' for UK research on memory mechanisms.txt",298,669,29,"Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption When a connection between two nerve cells is busy, it gets stronger

Three British researchers have won a prize worth one million euros, awarded each year for an ""outstanding contribution to European neuroscience"".

Tim Bliss, Graham Collingridge and Richard Morris revealed how strengthened connections between brain cells can store our memories.

Our present understanding of memory is built on their work, which unpicked the mechanisms and molecules involved.

This is the first time the Brain Prize has been won by an entirely UK team.

It is awarded by a Danish charitable foundation and the 2016 winners were announced in London on Tuesday.

Speaking to journalists at a media conference, Prof Morris explained it was the ""chemistry of memory"" that he and his colleagues had managed to illuminate.

Fire together, wire together

""Before this team got going, we had some idea about particular areas of the brain that might be involved in memory but what we didn't have was any real understanding of how it worked,"" explained the professor, who works at the University of Edinburgh.

The ""team"" of three winners never worked together in the same laboratory, but they have collaborated over the years.

""Memories change the brain - the brain is plastic,"" said Prof Bliss, who worked for many years at the National Institute of Medical Research in London and is now affiliated with the Francis Crick Institute.

Those changes occur at the junctions between nerve cells - synapses - and were described in a pioneering study by Bliss and a Norwegian colleague, Terje Lmo, in the 1970s.

They recorded brain cells in anaesthetised rabbits and found that repeatedly stimulating two connected neurons caused their connection to get stronger.

""If nerve cell A is connected to nerve cell B, and A takes part in firing B, then the synapse - the connection between A and B - will be strengthened,"" Prof Bliss explained.

I immediately recognised that this was a phenomenally interesting property... and decided that this was going to be my career Prof Graham Collingridge, University of Bristol

This paradigm, sometimes summarised as ""neurons that fire together, wire together"", was suggested by the Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb in the 1940s, but Bliss and Lmo were the first to glimpse it happening inside the brain.

Subsequently, Prof Collingridge - a researcher at the University of Bristol - worked on finding the specific molecules responsible.

Currently working at the University of Toronto in Canada, he spoke to journalists by telephone and paid tribute to the original Bliss and Lmo study.

Their paper was an inspiration to him as a young researcher, Prof Collingridge said.

""I immediately recognised that this was a phenomenally interesting property, which gave us the opportunity to understand the mechanisms of learning and memory in the brain - and decided that this was going to be my career.""

Finally, it was Prof Morris who demonstrated that the molecular systems identified by Prof Collingridge and his colleagues were, in fact, crucial for memories to form.

If those systems are disrupted, for example, rats and mice have difficulty learning to navigate a new environment.

The Brain Prize is awarded by the Grete Lundbeck European Brain Research Foundation, based in Copenhagen; a committee of eight neuroscientists makes the decision.

Billed as ""the world's most valuable prize for brain research"", its one million-euro value - to be shared by the three winners - marginally exceeds that of the biennial US $1m neuroscience prize awarded by the Kavli Foundation.

It will be presented in Copenhagen on 1 July by Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik.

The first British winner was geneticist Prof Karen Steel of King's College London, who shared the prize in 2012 for her work on deafness; Cambridge psychologist Trevor Robbins was one of three recipients in 2014.

"3","$29 Million That Should Be Spent On 'Jihad'.txt",353,804,38,"Osama Bin Laden's Will: $29 Million That Should Be Spent On 'Jihad'

i toggle caption Rahimullah Yousafzai/AP Rahimullah Yousafzai/AP

A handwritten will by Osama bin Laden said he had a fortune of ""about 29 million dollars"" and that most of it should be spent ""on Jihad,"" according to documents released by the U.S. government on Tuesday.

The will was among more than 100 documents made public by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The materials were captured when Navy SEALs killed the al-Qaida leader in a May 1, 2011, raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. This is the second batch of documents that has been made public. The first was released last May.

Many more documents were seized but have not been declassified and released.

The will was undated, but bin Laden said the money was in Sudan, where he lived for several years in the 1990s. He left Sudan for Afghanistan in 1996, just before the Taliban seized control of the country and welcomed him.

""I hope, for my brothers, sisters, and maternal aunts, to obey my will and to spend all the money that I have left in Sudan on Jihad, for the sake of Allah,"" bin Laden wrote. In the will, he also specified smaller sums for relatives and associates.

Media reports over the years have said that bin Laden was not able to take his fortune with him from Sudan. The will also refers to the Afghan cities of Jalalabad and Kandahar, where bin Laden and al-Qaida operated in the years leading up to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S.

Senior U.S. intelligence officials believe bin Laden's will dates to the 1990s. It was not clear how much money he had at the time of his death or what happened to it.

Bin Laden's wealth came from his father, who ran the most prominent construction company in Saudi Arabia for many years.

A Hands-On Leader

Most of the documents released Tuesday were from the final years of bin Laden's life and show a leader attempting to actively manage al-Qaida. One of his top priorities in his final days was exploiting the looming 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.

In contrast, U.S. officials frequently referred to bin Laden as ""hiding in a cave"" and cut off from the world.

The bin Laden materials reveal the constant tension between his desire to micromanage the group's day-to-day operations and his fears that he might be detected by sending directives to al-Qaida operatives scattered across many countries.

He was obsessed with secrecy and security and worried he could be killed at any moment. But he also took time to boast that he was able to evade U.S. detection for so long.

""Here we are in the tenth year of the war, and America and its allies are still chasing a mirage, lost at sea without a beach,"" he wrote in a letter that was undated, but apparently written in the final year of his life.

Here are some of highlights from the documents:

 He urged his group to gradually step up pressure on Iran, which kept some al-Qaida figures under house arrest after the 2001 attacks in the U.S., while allowing others to move around freely. His family members were also held in Iran. In one letter, he wrote:

""We asked several times that they be let go so that they could go to Pakistan. Tehran did not respond to that, so maybe you could attempt to work on releasing them to the Waziristan area of Pakistan, where we can make sure they are all right there with these tribes,"" bin Laden wrote.

 He warned one of his wives, Khairah, that a bugging or tracking device could be installed in her mouth when she was receiving a dental filling in Iran, where she was under house arrest.

""Please let me know in detail about anything that bothers you about any hospital in Iran or any suspicions that any of the brothers may have about chips planted in any way,"" he wrote. ""One of the ways, the syringe can be of the same size, but its head is slightly bigger than normal, that way, as I previously mentioned to you, they can insert a small chip in it to implant under the skin. The size of the chip is about the length of a grain of wheat and the width of a fine piece of vermicelli.""

 Bin Laden told a leader of al-Shabab, the radical Islamist group in Somalia, to attack French targets if Americans were not available. In addition, the group should execute a French hostage just before the country's national elections in 2012, an attempt to harm Nicolas Sarkozy, the president at the time. The group did seize French hostages, but did not execute them."

"7","After suspected drug overdose deaths, Fairplex has no plans to host raves in 2016.txt",417,883,42,"Seven months after two young women died of suspected drug overdoses after attending a rave concert at the fairgrounds, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Fair Assn. said Tuesday that the group is not planning to host raves this year.

We are not looking to host [electronic dance music] concerts or related events in 2016, association spokeswoman Renee Hernandez said in an email to The Times, responding to a question. She did not immediately answer a follow-up question as to why the decision was made.

The statement comes as the association has come under increasing scrutiny over the raves sponsored by concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment.

The Los Angeles County coroner has ruled that the death of UCLA student Tracy Nguyen, 18, was caused by an overdose of the illegal drug Ecstasy. Officials have not ruled on the cause of death for Cal State Channel Islands student Katie Dix, 19.

Critics of the raves at the county fairgrounds in Pomona, also known as the Fairplex, welcomed the decision.

This is a right step in the right direction, said Mario Ramos, a member of the group Protect Our Neighborhood, formed to oppose the raves after they arrived at the Fairplex in 2014. I just wish they made this decision a year and a half ago, prior to the deaths of the two women.

Judy St. John, a retired teacher who lives near the Fairplex, said raves should not return.

What about next year? she asked. It shouldn't be just for the rest of the year, it should be no more, ever.

A suspension of raves would mark a major reversal for the nonprofit that runs the fairgrounds on county-owned land.

In its 2014 annual report, the association touted its partnership with Live Nation and its Hard electronic dance music festival brand as introducing the campus to a new audience and strengthening our claim as a popular SoCal entertainment destination.

Representatives of Live Nation did not respond to requests for comment or to questions on where Hard Summer or Hard Day of the Dead will be held this year.

Drug overdoses have been a major problem at electronic dance music festivals, where the use of Ecstasy and similar substances is closely tied to the rave experience.

Hospitals that treated ravegoers

After the deaths of the two rave participants last summer, county Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich called the rave operator irresponsible and said, If raves are only going to exist when drugs and alcohol are available, then they are no longer welcome in Los Angeles County's facilities. Supervisor Hilda Solis said, No one should have to lose their life by attending a music event at one of our facilities.

Last summer, 49 people at the Aug. 1-2 Hard Summer music festival had to be transported to emergency rooms by ambulance. Officials say that is a big number and highly unusual for a single event.

There have now been at least 21 confirmed drug-related deaths among people who went to raves nationwide by Los Angeles-area companies since 2006. Ten have died in Southern California, and five in the Las Vegas area.

The announcement that the fairgrounds operator was not looking to hold raves in 2016 came moments after the Board of Supervisors signaled its intent Tuesday to regulate gatherings of more than 10,000 people on county-owned land, which would cover raves at the Fairplex.

The supervisors said the county should have the authority to make certain demands of operators of large events, such as ordering additional security and requiring more first-aid stations. Failure to meet the county's demands could result in an event not being allowed, the county counsel said.

Under the unanimous vote Tuesday, the supervisors directed county lawyers to draft an ordinance outlining these rules. A similar law is in place for state agencies.

The ordinance falls short of what the state-run Cow Palace near San Francisco opted to do in 2010: stop hosting raves, after that venue saw numerous drug-related overdoses and deaths.

Raves stopped being held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena in 2011, months after a 15-year-old girl who attended a rave died of an Ecstasy overdose.

Ecstasy can cause fatalities because it can trigger a sharp increase in body temperature to as high as 109 degrees  high enough to cause organ failure. Ravegoers are often told to drink plenty of water, but some drink too much, which can cause sodium levels to crash and trigger a seizure that makes it hard to breathe, leaving some people to fall into fatal comas.

The drug can also cause the breakdown of muscle into a chemical that damages the kidneys, which can be deadly.

Doctors have said overdosing ravegoers have come into the emergency room with convulsions and heart attacks, leaving some who survived with brain damage as well as impaired speech and walking ability.

The fair association has also been criticized by elected officials for how it operates. Last month, The Times reported that the association paid its chief executive, James Henwood Jr., more than $1 million in total compensation in 2014, the fifth straight year the organization reported financial losses.

State and county officials have ordered audits of the association. Officials at the association have defended the compensation practices as justified because of the complexity of the organization."
"8","Airbnb Is Changing The Way Tourists Hang Out  And Spend Their Cash  In Africa.txt",493,1118,68,"Airbnb Is Changing The Way Tourists Get To Know Africa

i toggle caption Courtesy of Godwin Ndosi Courtesy of Godwin Ndosi

When Godwin Ndosi first heard the word ""Airbnb,"" he said, ""Airbnb? Is that the name of a person?

Now it's the way he makes his living.

His introduction to the accommodations rental website came a year ago. Ndosi, a 23-year-old from Arusha, Tanzania, runs a safari business. A client had nowhere to stay after his hotel plans fell apart, so Ndosi invited him to spend the night at his pad.

When the client saw the place  a four-bedroom bungalow surrounded by palm trees, with a hammock swaying in a lush garden out back  he turned to Ndosi and said: ""This is beautiful. You could turn your house into a business. You know Airbnb?""

Ndosi did not know Airbnb, but ""when he left, I researched it and registered myself on the app,"" he says.

Since then, Ndosi has achieved ""superhost"" status  nearly 200 guests from countries including the Philippines, Malaysia, the U.S. and the U.K. have stayed with him and his parents, the ""Fun and Lovely Tanzanian Family."" His listing has a five-star rating on the site along with rave reviews that mention middle-of-the-night airport pickups and fresh milk from his cows with breakfast.

i toggle caption Anika Yvette/Courtesy of Godwin Ndosi Anika Yvette/Courtesy of Godwin Ndosi

Across Africa, people like Ndosi are earning money by renting out their homes on Airbnb, and in the process, they're encouraging global tourists to connect directly to the local economy.

Ndosi says that when he was growing up, folks in Arusha had a negative view of the tourists who came to explore Serengeti National Park or Mount Kilimanjaro. They brought little to the community because a handful of hotels had a monopoly on the industry, he says.

These accommodations push guests to eat at their restaurants, book their safari trips and shop at their souvenir stores. They may sell locally made handicrafts and clothing  but at a steep markup. A $5 shirt bought wholesale from a craftsman, for example, could be priced at $20 at the hotel shop.

""These people were coming and didn't buy anything from us. They just stayed in the lodges and took pictures of us,"" Ndosi says.

But, he says, ""We're in a different age now.""

Airbnb has upended the system. When the site launched in 2008, Africa was a minor part. That has changed, and now that more than 44,000 homes in Africa have been listed, the continent has become one of the company's fastest-growing regions. (South Africa, Morocco and Kenya top the continent's markets.)

Nicola D'Elia, Airbnb's first general manager for Africa and the Middle East, was hired from Facebook, where he helped with expansion in these regions. He says the goal is to have homes for rent absolutely everywhere.

""We want to bring tourists to parts of the continent that aren't covered by traditional accommodations  only places where you could stay in other people's homes,"" D'Elia says.

Making that vision a reality, says D'Elia, will ""help create a new generation of micro-entrepreneurs from local hosts to local businesses.""

Ndosi is proof that it's happening. When he registered for Airbnb, he had just graduated from college with a degree in wildlife tourism. He was applying for government jobs and graduate school and pursuing his passion of organizing small safari trips, but he worried about making an income. A tradition in his Maasai culture required him  the youngest in the family  to provide for his parents and look after their property, the bungalow.

The house has turned out to be the ideal business for him. His parents take up one room, and he rents out the other three. When all of the rooms are filled  he laughs as he shares this tidbit  he sleeps in a tent outside the house, in the garden.

Ndosi says his ""super friendly"" mom and dad, who help entertain the guests and answer questions about Tanzanian customs and culture, are key to his success. So is his pricing strategy: a stay with him costs just $15 a night, which includes Airbnb's 3 percent hosting fee.

""Everybody had a $20 price on Airbnb, and some even had $50 or $100,"" he says. ""But I never wanted to charge too much for a traveler to experience the local way of living.""

His low price and guest-first ethos seem to have paid off.

""Because of my reviews, people cry to stay with me  or tell me they'll pay double or triple to stay with me just for five days,"" he says.

Business was slow initially, because it's tough to snag Airbnb guests before anyone has put up a review. But after four months of waiting, Ndosi got his first guests: a trio of tourists from Malaysia, who'd decided to pick a place based on the host profile. They liked Ndosi's simple and short description on his page, so they went with him.

They meant to stay for one day but stuck around for 10. Later, they told Ndosi that after they came to Arusha and stayed with him and his parents, they ""found their family.""

His guests tend to create lasting bonds during their visits.

Ndosi shares a story of two of his Airbnb guests who visited Ambureni, a village outside Arusha where Ndosi's family is from. The Swiss couple was shocked by what they saw: poverty and a lack of infrastructure. They decided to help raise funds for the orphanage and a new hospital.

Ndosi says amazing people have stayed at his bungalow in the past year, but there's one odd thing he has noticed. He has never hosted a fellow Tanzanian.

""Locals don't want to stay with locals because they're already locals,"" Ndosi says.

Airbnb is on the case, D'Elia says. This year, it's working to get more people living in African countries to use Airbnb when they travel domestically, starting with one of Airbnb's biggest markets: South Africa. And it's looking at Africa-friendly payment solutions, like M-Pesa, a mobile payment app widely used across the continent.

Maybe that will make business even busier for Ndosi, who has earned enough cash through Airbnb to fund his entire graduate school education, which he hopes to start soon. The publicity has helped him gain more clients for his safari company. And he's investing in more rooms and accommodations across Arusha to expand his Airbnb business  something he now wants to do full time.

Last October, he finally heard back from one of the government jobs he applied for. He got the gig.

How did he respond?

""I had the guts to say no, I don't need your job,"" he says. ""I'm happy."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Al Qaeda leaders discussed a plan in 2010 to arrange a peace deal with the government of Mauritania, according to documents seized by U.S. Navy Seals when they raided Osama bin Laden's Pakistani hideout in 2011 and made public by the U.S. government on Tuesday.

The plan suggested that al Qaeda's North African affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), would promise ""not to carry out any military activity in Mauritania"", initially for a year, with the possibility of renewal.

In return, the proposal says, Mauritanian authorities would release all al Qaeda prisoners, commit not to attack AQIM, and pay it 10 to 20 million euros ($11 million-$22 million) a year to ""prevent the kidnapping of tourists"".

Senior U.S. intelligence officials familiar with the documents said they had no evidence that any such deal was ever done, or that the militant group had contacted anyone in Mauritania to make the proposal.

El Housseine Ould Nagi, legal counsel to Mauritania's president, denied that his government had had anything to do with such a deal.

""We have always been against paying ransoms and indirect financing of terrorism. Consequently, there has never been a secret accord between us and those people,"" he said.

Unlike its neighbors Mali and Algeria, Mauritania has enjoyed relative freedom from AQIM attacks in past years, especially since 2011. It has also faced international criticism for freeing jihadist prisoners, such as a former spokesman for the AQIM-linked group Ansar Dine. Others have escaped in opaque circumstances.

However, Mauritania also hosts a regional security body known as the Group of Five Sahel and is working with Western allies France and the United States to counter a growing Islamist insurgency in the region.

Olga Bogorad, an independent security analyst specializing in Islamist groups, said it was possible that Mauritania was playing a double game:

""On one side, it has a deal with AQIM and enjoys no terror attacks on its soil ... and on the other, it participates in counter-terrorism efforts to avoid criticism and probably to get support.""

AQIM, a spinoff of what was originally an Algerian-based Salafist militant group, made its first public appearance in January 2007 and rose to prominence mainly through its involvement in kidnapping Westerners for ransom in countries in the Sahel region including Mauritania, Niger and Mali.

In July 2012, the head of the U.S. military's Africa Command described AQIM as al Qaeda's wealthiest affiliate.

The al Qaeda document also says that a ""truce"" with Mauritania would allow AQIM to ""put the cadres in safe rear bases"" that it said would be available there while enabling the group to focus on Algeria.

"12","American Reform rabbis warn of alienation from Israel.txt",468,1089,51,"JERUSALEM (AP)  A recent gathering of American Reform rabbis in Jerusalem was meant to celebrate the small gains the liberal Jewish movement has made in Israel in recent years. But a series of comments by Israeli officials denigrating the group marred the event, reflecting an awkward relationship that many fear is alienating the world's second-largest Jewish community from Israel.

The Reform Movement is the largest stream of Judaism in the United States, claiming to represent 1.5 million people, and its members provide a key source of financial support and political advocacy for Israel.

But the movement is marginal in Israel, where religious affairs are dominated by the Orthodox rabbinical establishment. Israeli lawmakers, both secular and ultra-Orthodox, have repeatedly disparaged the group, questioning their Judaism and accusing them of promoting Jewish assimilation.

""How do you ask Jews around the world to support Israel politically, economically, socially ... and at the same time you have these ministers who say to our people 'you're not really Jewish' or 'you don't have a place here in Israel?' That incongruity is a real problem for us,"" said Rabbi Steven Fox, the chief executive of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which held its septennial convention in Israel last week. The group represents 2,000 rabbis.

In the U.S., Reform synagogues are commonplace, characterized by practices such as mixed-gender prayers, services led by female rabbis and members who drive to synagogue on the Sabbath  customs that violate Orthodox norms.

In Israel, Reform Judaism is often seen as a curiosity and in some cases, a threat. This in turn has placed obstacles in the way of the movement's effort to make inroads in Israel, beaten back by an Orthodox monopoly over Jewish rituals such as marriage, burials and conversions.

Reform rabbis have made small gains in Israel, and in January, the movement was jubilant over perhaps its greatest victory  Israel's announcement that it would create a special mixed-gender prayer area at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.

The wall, managed by an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who opposes having Reform customs at the site, is the holiest place where Jews can pray. The new area will also permit women to wear prayer shawls and skullcaps, a rite reserved for men under Orthodox custom.

The announcement came after three years of painstaking negotiations between Israeli officials and the liberal streams of Judaism and appeared to mark a historic turning point in relations between Israel and diaspora Jews.

But right after the plan was approved, Israel's secular Tourism Minister Yariv Levin said the Reform movement was a ""waning world."" He accused it of tolerating intermarriage, encouraging assimilation and predicted the mixed-prayer area would become unnecessary within two or three generations. Under religious law, Jews cannot marry non-Jews.

Even after Reform rabbis criticized him, Levin expressed no remorse. ""It's very important that we'll be aware of the problem of assimilation and do our best efforts in order to solve it,"" he told The Associated Press.

A chorus of other lawmakers, most of them Orthodox, have publicly lashed out at the Reform movement. As the rabbis' convention was kicking off, a legislator from an ultra-Orthodox party compared the movement to the ""mentally ill.""

The rhetoric has put Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a tough spot. Early this month, he rejected ""disparaging and divisive remarks"" about Reform Jews and called the movement ""part and parcel of the Jewish people.""

He also met the visiting American rabbis. But, possibly wary of antagonizing religious factions in his coalition, his office made no announcement of the meeting, as it often does with high-profile visitors.

Fox, the rabbi group's chief executive, said the encounter was ""more positive"" than past meetings with Netanyahu, though they were surprised by the absence of the public announcement.

""The ministers here paint us as if we're not really Jewish. And the ignorance they display makes my congregants ... think 'is Israel really that backward of a nation?' It reflects poorly on the state of Israel,"" said Rabbi Denise Eger, another leader of the Central Conference of American Rabbis.

Netanyahu's office said he does not put out public statements on all his meetings. It declined to discuss the meeting with the Reform rabbis or say why he had decided to keep silent.

For decades, American Jewry  the second largest Jewish community in the world after Israel  has served as a bedrock of support for Israel. But there are signs of that support eroding, particularly among younger and more liberal Jews.

Jay Ruderman, president of the Ruderman Family Foundation, a Boston-based group that teaches Israeli leaders about the American Jewish community, said that at a time when Israel faces so many challenges, it makes no ""strategic sense"" for Israeli leaders to alienate American Jews.

""A smart politician would say, 'These Jews are different than us, but they play a very important strategic role,'"" he said.

Beyond the Western Wall compromise, the Reform rabbis say they do see progress elsewhere as well.

Israel's Supreme Court ruled last month that the country's ritual baths must accept all converts to Judaism, even those who have undergone non-Orthodox conversions outside the country.

The rabbis also point to the movement's small but growing base in Israel and their invitation to a parliamentary committee during their convention last week, where lawmakers, mainly from centrist parties, showered them with gratitude and praise.

""When I read statements by the Israeli tourism minister about Reform Judaism in the United States, it comes from a denial and a misunderstanding and an ignorance about the importance of the powerful contribution that you make to relations between the two countries,"" Nachman Shai, a lawmaker from the centrist Zionist Union, told the packed auditorium, where women and men wore rainbow-colored skullcaps and sang Hatikva, Israel's national anthem.

Reform leaders told the meeting that the harsh reactions from some lawmakers were an unfortunate but expected response to the gains the movement has made.

""These are clearly changes that are long overdue,"" said Rabbi Richard Jacobs, the President of the Union for Reform Judaism. ""The change signals to the ultra-Orthodox that there will no longer be a monopoly."""

But a reliance on tourism makes the nation vulnerable to downturns in the world market.

Antigua has tangled with the United States over its online gambling industry, which at its height employed more than 4,000 people and was a major contributor to the economy. But it shrunk drastically because of US restrictions, the Antiguan government says.

The Bird family has dominated the country's politics since its independence in 1981 until 1994. Underlying this stability was a succession of scandals, including allegations of corruption. The Bird family was also accused of abuse of authority.

In 2009, the country's economy was rocked by news that its single biggest investor, Texan billionaire Allen Stanford, had been charged with massive fraud by the US authorities.

The Pennsylvania Superior Court granted Cosby a postponement Tuesday while the court decides whether to hear Cosby's pretrial appeal. His preliminary hearing had been set for next week.

Cosby, 78, is accused of drugging and molesting a Temple University employee in his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004.

He said he had a promise from a former district attorney that he would never be charged over his encounter with Andrea Constand. However, a different district attorney reopened the case last year and filed charges in December, weeks before the statute of limitations expired.

The preliminary hearing to determine if probable cause exists to send the case to trial had been set for March 8. The hearing seemed likely to be postponed unless the Superior Court quickly decided to quash his appeal.

Prosecutors have argued that he does not have the right to a pretrial appeal and should instead file the usual post-trial appeal if he is convicted. A Montgomery County judge who heard two days of evidence on the issue agreed and refused to ask the appeals court to intervene. The judge, Common Pleas Judge Steven O'Neill, could end up with the case if it goes to trial.

O'Neill found no credible evidence of a binding agreement that Cosby would never be charged. The former district attorney, Bruce Castor, had testified for Cosby but acknowledged there was no written agreement forged.

Cosby is embroiled in civil litigation in several states, but the Pennsylvania case is the only one to lead to criminal charges. He has teams of lawyers for the case itself, for appellate issues and for a countersuit he filed last month against accuser Andrea Constand. He also is embroiled in defamation lawsuits with some of the dozens of women around the country who accuse him of molesting them.

Cosby has posted $1 million bail in the Pennsylvania case. He faces five to 10 years in prison if convicted of felony indecent assault."

Bottom club Aston Villa were well beaten by Everton as home supporters walked out in protest at American owner Randy Lerner.

Fans headed for the exits in the 74th minute - Villa were formed in 1874 - with their side trailing 3-0.

Ramiro Funes Mori gave Everton the lead by meeting Kevin Mirallas' corner before Aaron Lennon's close-range finish doubled their lead.

Media playback is not supported on this device Early goal hit Villa confidence - Garde

Romelu Lukaku made it 3-0 before Rudy Gestede headed a consolation for Villa.

The result leaves the home side eight points from safety with 10 games left.

Relive all the drama from Villa Park

Reaction from Villa Park and all of Tuesday's Premier League games

Fans vent their anger at Lerner

Mathematically, Villa can still avoid a first relegation since 1987.

Yet with five of their remaining 10 games against Manchester City (away), Tottenham (home), Chelsea (home), Manchester United (away) and Arsenal (away), they have their work cut out to avoid the drop.

Rudy Gestede finished a six-man move for Aston Villa's consolation goal - which started with a pass from goalkeeper Brad Guzan

The mood inside Villa Park was ugly throughout, with fans in the sub-30,000 crowd making their feelings known towards the club's hierarchy.

Those who joined the 74th-minute protest - which will be repeated at their next two home games - missed substitute Gestede's goal from a Jordan Veretout cross.

However, it could not prevent Villa from a ninth defeat in 17 league games - and third in a row - under Remi Garde.

Analysis - BBC Radio 5 live's Pat Murphy at Villa Park

""The mood is turning ugly. The crowd are chanting 'from European nights to relegation fights - we want Lerner out'. A few fans are pointing fingers at chief executive Tom Fox in the directors' box.

""There are hundreds of fans streaming out of Villa Park. There are a lot of people who have paid a lot of money walking out. The Villa fans are voting with their feet. I haven't seen anything like this before at Villa.

Aston Villa fans call for the departure of owner Randy Lerner

""I remember the demonstrations against Doug Ellis, but he must seem a great chairman in retrospect. This is the worst team I've seen in 41 years of reporting on Villa, simple as that.""

Can Martinez bring success to Everton?

There is renewed pressure on Roberto Martinez following the multi-million pound investment in Everton by Iranian billionaire Farhad Moshiri.

Yet if the Spaniard is feeling the heat, he did a great job disguising it, taking time to shake hands with Villa's mascot and sign autographs during the match.

His side controlled the game from start to finish, racing into a 2-0 lead as Villa left Funes Mori in space to score before Lennon fired home after being teed up by the impressive Mirallas.

Funes Mori turned provider as Lukaku's knee helped make it 3-0 and it could have been more - Bryan Oviedo had a shot cleared off the line.

There will be much tougher tests for Martinez and Everton but, having climbed above neighbours Liverpool into 10th spot, this was a highly satisfactory night for them.

Man of the match - Kevin Mirallas (Everton)

Kevin Mirallas only started as Everton midfielder Tom Cleverley was ill but he was an influential figure as he provided two assists during a captivating display

What the managers said

Aston Villa boss Remi Garde: ""When you prepare a plan and so early in the game you have to change it, it's very difficult. We were too fragile, we didn't take the advantage of playing at home.

""The positive sign is that we never gave up and we reduced the score. But it's difficult to keep a positive mood when you miss chances like we missed today.""

Everton manager Roberto Martinez: ""We managed the game well - it's always difficult when you're away from home to get a real good composure but we had that. It's a performance that won't get the credit it deserves - Aston Villa had a lot of fight.

Media playback is not supported on this device Martinez 'delighted' with Everton display

""I feel that the squad is in a very good moment - we've been very consistent the last six games. We're enjoying our football and playing with a lot of confidence.""

The stats you need to know

No Premier League team has survived having taken 16 points or fewer from their opening 28 games.

Aston Villa have lost three successive Premier League games for the first time since November.

Everton are unbeaten in their past eight Premier League away games (W3 D5).

Lukaku has scored 17 Premier League goals this season, equalling his best return - in 2012-13.

Mirallas provided his first Premier League assist in 454 days.

Lennon has scored more Premier League goals this season (four) than he did in his previous two campaigns combined (three).

What's next

It does not get any easier for Villa. They face teams chasing the title in both of their next two games - visiting Manchester City on Saturday (15:00 GMT) before hosting Tottenham on 13 March.

Everton will try to make it four wins in five Premier League games when they host West Ham on Saturday (15:00 GMT)."

US astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko have touched down on Earth after almost a year in space.

Their 340-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is twice the length of a normal stay.

Their extended tour is part of an effort to study the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the body.

But scientists will gain further insights by comparing Scott Kelly with his Earthbound identical twin, Mark.

A Soyuz capsule carrying Kelly, Kornienko and Russian crew member Sergey Volkov parachuted down on to a steppe in Kazakhstan at 10:26 local time (04:26 GMT).

The mission is a record for the ISS and will give Cmdr Kelly a tally of 520 cumulative days in space, over four flights.

Tim Peake's space plant experiment

Cmdr Kelly has also returned rocket (salad) seeds that were taken up to the orbiting outpost by UK astronaut Tim Peake in December. They will be distributed to schools to allow pupils to compare their growth with rocket plants that have stayed on Earth.

The idea behind the twin study is to help minimise extraneous factors as scientists research how genetically identical individuals respond to different conditions over a year.

Media caption ""I could go another year"" says astronaut Scott Kelly as he ends his 340-day mission

The harsh space environment takes its toll in the form of muscle atrophy, sleep problems, bone loss, vision impairment and radiation exposure. But some of the most pronounced effects are on the mind.

Before landing, Cmdr Kelly told reporters during a live link-up: ""Physically I feel pretty good... but the hardest part is being isolated in the physical sense from people on the ground who are important to you. There's a loss of connection.""

From Kazakhstan, Cmdr Kelly will be flown to Houston in the US, where researchers at the US space agency (Nasa) will begin a series of scientific checks.

Mark Kelly, who was an astronaut, now retired, has been undergoing tests of his own on Earth during his brother's sojourn on the ISS.

Comparisons between the twins should allow scientists to deepen their understanding of the subtle physical and psychological shifts that occur during long stays on orbit.

Nasa says the research should inform its stated aim of one day sending humans to Mars.

After returning from an extended stay in the weightless environment of space, many astronauts have difficulty walking unaided.

Shortly after landing, Kelly, Kornienko and Volkov will enter a medical tent to participate in a series of ""field tests"" that will assess their balance, co-ordination and ability to walk.

Image copyright NASA Image caption Comparisons between Scott Kelly (R) and his Earthbound twin Mark should yield insights into subtle changes to the body

Returning ISS crews have immediate access to medical assistance, but future crews to Mars will have little time to recover once they land on the Red Planet's surface. Scientists want to devise ways to prevent injury and improve their recovery time.

""We go through about an hour of field tests of various kinds - one is even like an obstacle course, where you run around, stand up from a sitting position and jump,"" Cmdr Kelly said.

Despite the length of their flight, Kelly and Kornienko are still some way shy of the record for the longest single spaceflight, which is held by the Russian Valery Polyakov, who spent 437 consecutive days aboard the Mir space station in the mid-1990s.

On Monday, Scott Kelly handed over command of the space station to his American colleague Timothy Kopra, who remains on the orbiting outpost with Tim Peake and the Russian Yuri Malenchenko.

The next crew, consisting of the American Jeffrey Williams and the Russians Aleksey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, is set to launch on a Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in Kazakhstan on 18 March.

"20","Atletico ease past Sociedad, cut Barcelona's lead.txt",298,502,21,"Madrid (AFP) - Atletico Madrid closed the gap on La Liga leaders Barcelona to five points with a routine 3-0 win over Real Sociedad on Tuesday.

A bright start from the hosts was rewarded when Diego Reyes turned Koke's low cross into his own net after just eight minutes.

Saul Niguez's acrobatic volley doubled Atletico's advantage a minute into the second-half before Antoine Griezmann's penalty rounded off the scoring.

Barca can restore their eight-point lead when they travel to Rayo Vallecano on Thursday looking to set a Spanish football record by stretching their unbeaten run to 35 games.

Third-placed Real Madrid are now seven points adrift of Atletico ahead of their trip to Levante on Wednesday.

""We started the game very well from middle to front which opened up the game for us,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone.

View gallery Atletico Madrid's forward Luciano Vietto (R) celebrates with his teammates during a Spanish leag 

""It is very difficult to imagine Barcelona losing games. We are concentrating on ourselves and bettering our own standards.""

Buoyed by coming out on top against Real in the capital city derby on Saturday, Atletico started full of confidence and should have killed the game off before half-time.

The opener arrived when Koke's dangerous low cross from the right caused confusion between Reyes and Geronimo Rulli and the Mexican defender shanked the ball into his own net.

Diego Godin should have made it 2-0 moments later when he blasted over Jose Maria Gimenez's flick-on from Koke's corner.

Rulli then redeemed himself with smart saves from Griezmann and Luciano Vietto, although in truth both strikers placed their shots too close to the keeper.

Atletico did finally get the second goal with the first attack of the second half as Vietto's lofted cross picked out Saul's late run into the box and his bicycle-kick had too much power for Rulli.

The only slight concern for Atletico boss Diego Simeone was the sight of Godin having to be replaced by Lucas Hernandez shortly afterwards, with the vital return-leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with PSV Eindhoven just two weeks away.

Griezmann was Atletico's hero at the weekend and he won the chance to round off the scoring against his former club when he was tripped inside the area by Antonio de la Bella on the hour mark.

The French international dusted himself off to send Rulli the wrong way for his 21st goal of the season.

Griezmann was then also withdrawn with a meeting against Gary Neville's Valencia on Sunday in mind.

Sociedad began to threaten for the first time in the match in the final half hour as Carlos Vela fired just wide before Jonathas headed against the post.

At the bottom of the table Las Palmas secured a huge 4-0 win over fellow strugglers Getafe to move three points clear of the relegation zone.

Willian Jose, Jonathan Viera and a Tana double consigned Getafe to a seventh straight defeat which leaves them just two points above the drop zone."

Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden left a personal fortune of around $29m (21m) after his death in a raid in 2011, his will shows.

The will is among a trove of documents released to US media. It was seized in the US assault in Abbotabad, Pakistan.

He referred to the money as being in Sudan, but it is not clear whether it was cash or assets.

Bin Laden lived in Sudan for five years in the 1990s as a guest of the Sudanese government.

It is not known whether any of the money made its way to his heirs.

Feared that a dentist had planted a tracking device in his wife's tooth

Planned a major media campaign to mark the 10th anniversary of the 11 September attacks in the US

We couldnt rule out a situation where sterling falls and doesnt have a floor, said Rupert Harrison, chief macro strategist for multi-asset strategies at BlackRock and a former special adviser to U.K. Chancellor George Osborne. In this traditional sterling crisis, the Bank of England would be forced to raise interest rates even as the economy weakened.

Co-author Ewen Cameron Watt, chief investment strategist of BlackRocks Investment Institute, said a severe outcome would be the pound falling to around $1.20, from $1.395 on Tuesday afternoon.

Harrison said this wasnt the most likely outcome of a so-called Brexit, but a more probable scenario would still result in a significant further fall in the pound. The uncertainty between now and the June 23 vote also meant there will probably be a further drop before polling booths open, he added. Sterling has already fallen more than 5% this year against both the euro and the dollar and is down 12% against the dollar since last summer.

He said the boy's mother, Gabriela Zapata, had five days to show the boy to the authorities.

On Monday, Mr Morales said he wanted to meet his son, after a relative of Ms Zapata said the boy was living in an undisclosed location in Bolivia.

But he has now said he does not believe his son is alive.

""I am totally convinced that this boy has unfortunately died,"" Mr Morales said in a news conference..

He had a relationship with Ms Zapata between 2005 and 2007, when she got pregnant and the baby was born.

Ms Zapata told him at the time that their baby had fallen ill soon after birth and had died.

""I ask myself why since 2007 did they hide him from me? For what reasons did they distance me?"" he said on Monday.

Bolivia's Transparency Minister, Lenny Valdivia, said the mother's account of what has happened since 2007 is full of contradictions.

""She told the president that the baby was born. Then he gave money to help bring him up. It was only when he demanded to see the child, many years ago, that she said the baby had died,"" said Ms Valdivia.

Ms Zapata, who is in her late 20s, was arrested on Saturday, as part of a corruption investigation.

She worked as a top executive for Chinese building company CAMC.

Last month, Bolivian media reported that in recent years the company had been awarded contracts with the government worth $500m (360m).

The opposition accused Mr Morales of using his influence to benefit the company because of the connection with his former girlfriend.

Mr Morales rejected the accusations and said they were part of a strategy from right-wing forces to undermine his credibility ahead of a referendum.

He was seeking to change the constitution to allow him to run for a fourth successive term, but the referendum was rejected by 51.3% of voters.

Mr Morales has been in power since 2006 and his current term runs out in 2020.

Ms Zapata has not as yet made any comments on the corruption allegations."
"25","Brazil arrests Facebook executive in row over police access to data.txt",257,464,23,"Sao Paulo (AFP) - Brazilian police arrested the vice president of Facebook for Latin America on Tuesday after the social media giant refused access to data the authorities said was important in a drug probe.

Diego Dzodan was detained following ""repeated non-compliance with court orders"" to share Facebook data requested in a drug trafficking case, federal police said.

Brazilian authorities were also seeking access to the network's popular mobile phone chat tool, WhatsApp.

""This information was required to produce evidence to be used in an organized crime and drug trafficking investigation,"" the police statement said.

The probe, police said, is being held in court, but in secret, with no public allowed.

The standoff dates back four months, with an order issued by a judge in Lagarto, in Sergipe state, where the police investigation against an alleged drug trafficking gang is taking place. According to Brazilian media reports, traffickers had been using WhatsApp to discuss their business.

When Facebook refused to comply, Brazilian authorities imposed fines, starting with 50,000 reais (about $12,500) daily beginning two months ago, and which rose to 1 million reais ($250,000) a month ago, Sergipe federal police told AFP.

Dzodan, an Argentine national, was arrested at his home in Sao Paulo and was being held pending questioning.

- 'Extreme, disproportionate' -

US billionaire Mark Zuckerberg's companies slammed Brazil's approach.

""We are disappointed with the extreme and disproportionate measure of having a Facebook executive escorted to a police station in connection with a case involving WhatsApp, which operates separately from Facebook,"" Facebook said in a statement.

""Facebook has always been and will be available to address any questions Brazilian authorities may have.""

WhatsApp insisted that it had no technical means for cooperating.

""We are disappointed that law enforcement took this extreme step. WhatsApp cannot provide information we do not have,"" it said in a statement.

""We cooperated to the full extent of our ability in this case and while we respect the important job of law enforcement, we strongly disagree with its decision.""

It's not the first arm-wrestle between Brazilian justice authorities and Facebook.

In December, a judge ordered the suspension of WhatsApp for 12 hours after it failed to hand over information during another criminal investigation. The stoppage, which provoked widespread anger, was overturned on appeal.

Three years ago Google was in the firing line. The search engine giant's top Brazil executive was accused of breaking election laws when he refused to remove videos on YouTube that were critical of a mayoral candidate in Mato Grosso do Sul state.

In the United States, Apple is embroiled in its own row with the government over a refusal to cooperate with the FBI in unlocking an iPhone used by one of the shooters in a mass killing by a couple in San Bernardino, California, last year."

Police in Brazil have arrested the vice president of the social media company Facebook in Latin America.

Diego Dzodan, an Argentine national, has repeatedly refused to comply with court orders to hand over data for use in a criminal investigation into drugs trafficking, police said.

His arrest relates to the messaging service WhatsApp, owned by Facebook.

In a statement, Facebook called Mr Dzodan's arrest an ""extreme and disproportionate measure"".

Mr Dzodan's arrest was ordered by a judge in the north-eastern state of Sergipe.

He was held as he left his house in an exclusive area of Sao Paulo on Tuesday morning.

Judge Marcel Maia Montalvao had in two previous instances issued fines against Facebook for refusing to release WhatsApp data.

The information was needed as part ""secrete judicial investigations involving organised crime and drug trafficking,"" he said.

In a statement, Facebook said it was ""disappointed with the extreme and disproportionate measure"".

""Facebook has always been and will be available to address any questions Brazilian authorities may have,"" the company said.

"29","California's snowpack falls below average, sparking new drought fears.txt",254,453,21,"After a promising start to winter, Californias snowpack has shrunk to below-average levels, causing state water officials to redouble their calls for water conservation.

On Tuesday, the statewide snowpack stood at only 83% of average for the day, a result the California Department of Water Resources blamed on fall and winter seasons that have brought only moderate precipitation and relatively warm temperatures.

Officials say that traditionally, half of the states annual water falls as rain or snow during December, January and February, so the declining state of the snowpack is cause for some concern.

See more of our top stories on Facebook >>

A healthy, robust snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is crucial to easing Californias prolonged drought and the water contained in the snow is what is most important to officials. In normal years, the snowpack supplies about one-third of Californias water needs as it melts and runs off into reservoirs during the hotter spring and summer months.

Mother Nature is not living up to predictions by some that a Godzilla El Nio would produce much more precipitation than usual this winter, Department of Water Resources Director Mark Cowin said in a statement. We need conservation as much as ever.

DWR officials conducted the agency's third manual snow survey of the season on Tuesday, trekking 90 miles east of Sacramento to Phillips Station. Surveyors measured snow there that was 58.3 inches deep with 27.1 inches of water content  the best for the early March measuring period since 2011, officials said.

But the daily reports from about 125 automated snow sensors across the state provide a more accurate picture. Electronic readings of the northern Sierra Nevada showed the snowpacks water content at 89% of normal for March 1; the central region was 85% of normal; the southern region was 75%.

In March 2015, the water content in the snowpack statewide was only 19% of normal.

Right now, were obviously better than last year but still way below what would be considered adequate for any reasonable level of recovery, said Frank Gehrke, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program.

DWR officials have said the statewide snowpack would need to be 150% of average on April 1 to make a serious dent in, or potentially end the drought. They are expected to manually measure the snowpack again on or around that day, when snowpack levels traditionally peak before beginning to melt.

"30","Can You Keep a Secret_.txt",921,2151,99,"Spymasters are supposed to be good at keeping their mouths shut, so its striking how many heads of the Central Intelligence Agency have published memoirs. Just in the years since September 11th, three former directorsGeorge Tenet, Leon Panetta, and now Michael V. Haydenhave felt compelled to tell tales. (A fourth, David Petraeus, coperated with his biographer so fully that he provided her with classified information.) They are no doubt driven by the same motives that lead other public figures to write autobiographiesmoney, narcissism, score-settling, concern for their place in history. Spooks in general have had a lot to answer for in the past decade and a half: the 9/11 attacks themselves, Iraqs nonexistent weapons of mass destruction, secret prisons, torture, warrantless eavesdropping, the bulk collection of Americans data, and targeted killings. On the inside, they hold their breath for years; once outside, they wont shut up. Within the limits set by the C.I.A.s Publications Review Board, silence is an easy code to break.

Hayden was an Air Force officer who retired as a four-star general. He spent just about his whole career as an intelligence officerproviding intelligence to B-52 pilots in Vietnam, serving as chief of intelligence for U.S. forces in Europe during the Bosnian war, and then running the Air Intelligence Agency. In 1999, Hayden was appointed to lead the National Security Agency. He had the right rsumall N.S.A. directors are senior military officersas well as the luck of timing and circumstance that so often determines who gets the coveted jobs in government. But the director of the C.I.A.a position Hayden held from 2006 to the start of the Obama Administration, after a brief stopover as deputy director of national intelligenceis rarely a career intelligence officer. And before Hayden nobody had ever led both the N.S.A. and the C.I.A. Hayden had clearly impressed the politicians, made few powerful enemies among his colleagues, and avoided scandal. In short, he was an excellent bureaucrat, and he spent his entire professional life guarding the countrys secrets, among them some of the deepest and darkest.

Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror (Penguin Press) suffers from the usual problems of the official memoir. All autobiographies are self-serving, but those of public figures tend to be unapologetically so. Hayden includes liberal excerpts from a graduation speech he delivered at his alma mater, Duquesne University, and reports on the standing ovation that greeted him. Playing to the Edge is also badly written, with no trace of a ghostwriter or editor. Hayden is a devout Steelers fan, and his style is jock-bureaucratictough talk clotted with insider terminology. At one point, he writes, I have spent my adult life working in American intelligence. It has been quite an honor. Generally well resourced. A global mission. No want of issues. And it was a hell of a ride. At another: The head of operations wanted to try the Thin Thread approach, retain US metadata that we were collecting in our foreign intelligence activities, encrypt it, limit access to it through a kind of two key protocol, and then (when indicated) chain through the metadata to other contacts.

This matter of language is important. Professional jargonon Wall Street, in humanities departments, in government officescan be a fence raised to keep out the uninitiated and permit those within it to persist in the belief that what they do is too hard, too complex, to be questioned. Jargon acts not only to euphemize but to license, setting insiders against outsiders and giving the flimsiest notions a scientific aura. Repeat the phrase chain through the metadata enough times and it sounds like a law of nature rather than a contentious policy. In the case of the intelligence world, where a high degree of insularity is essential, the cloak of language renders spooks and their civilian critics mutually alien. The tendency on each side is to deny that the other has any real right to exist.

Hayden was running the N.S.A. when, following September 11th, President Bush told the agency to intercept the content of certain calls between American and foreign telephones without a court order, and to store all the metadata on calls made to, from, and within the United States. Hayden asked an agency lawyer for an overnight legal opinion and got an answer (a more-than-plausible theory about its lawfulness) that a more skeptical mind could have shredded. But Hayden also knew exactly what his superiors at the White House wanted. He had the tools and was eager to use them. You dont rise to the top of the intelligence community by asking whether can and should are always the same.

This proved the case with torture, too. Hayden wasnt yet at the C.I.A. when the agency, with the backing of the Bush White House and the Justice Department, tried waterboarding and other physical efforts to break Al Qaeda suspects in secret overseas prisons. By the time Hayden took over, many, though not all, of the practices had ended. Contemplating an order to subject a detainee named Muhammad Rahim al-Afghani to sleep deprivation and a liquid diet, Hayden writes, I remember staring down at the page, pen in hand, hesitating to take that step. Needless to say, he signed. Afghanis interrogators got nothing useful from their prisoner; Hayden suggests that this was because the harshest techniques had by then been taken off the table.

Hayden insists that vital information about Al Qaeda came from these techniques. Hes contradicted by a thick Senate Intelligence Committee report, numerous journalistic investigations, and the accounts of certain intelligence officers. When it comes to detainee deaths, innocent men wrongfully held in brutal conditions, and other abuses, Hayden barely glances over his shoulder: There were occasional mistakes. On the usefulness of the N.S.A.s Terrorist Surveillance Program, which some insiders have dismissed as producing little valuable information, Hayden is similarly confident: We were able to brief real connections between overseas terrorists and people in the United States. . . . It is clear that Stellarwindthe code name for the information collected under the programcovered a quadrant where we had no other tools. What could be wrong with that? The public may never be able to assess where the truth lies.

In his last days in government, at the start of the Obama Administration, Hayden fought bitterly against the release of the Bush Justice Departments torture memos, insisting that the revelations constituted a betrayal and would damage C.I.A. officers morale beyond repair. In 2014, when the Senate Intelligence Committee released its report, which singled out Hayden for misleading the committee in many instances, he lashed out even more furiously. The report is a damning document on the brutality of the C.I.A.s practices, the shoddiness of its management, and the mendacity of its leaders. Haydens case against the report comes down to the fact that it was written by the committees Democrat members and staff. Hayden seems more ambivalent about eavesdropping than about torture. He admits that Stellarwind did indeed raise important questions about the right balance between security and liberty, and Snowdens disclosures no doubt accelerated and intensified that discussion. And last week he sided with Apple in its privacy dispute with the F.B.I. But techniques like waterboarding and rectal hydration raise no questions for Hayden.

He has a number of glowing things to say about George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, none about Barack Obama. Bush is a good listener, avid for details, ready to hear hard truths from his intel people and make policy accordingly. Obama, on the other hand, is indecisive, hypocritical, andon issues like torture and negotiating with Iranwrong. Hayden devotes far more energy to answering critical coverage in the Times and the Washington Post than to analyzing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In general, he doesnt care for investigative journalists or congressional Democrats. First-rate intelligence reporters like the Times James Risen, the Posts Dana Priest, and this magazines Jane Mayer arent just a pain in the ass, in his viewthey have low motives and unfair agendas. He cant fathom why the legitimate role of the press might be to ferret out secrets that officials like him are sworn to guard, or why the C.I.A.s destruction of its own interrogation tapes looked like a coverup of a crime. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and Senator Ron Wyden arent good-faith critics of the agencytheyre partisan hypocrites. At one point, Hayden quotes a line from Bob Dylans Absolutely Sweet Marie: To live outside the law, you must be honest. Hayden adds, Especially with yourself. All the time. In other words, if the intelligence agencies are going to push the limits of law, policy, and technology, with minimal oversightif theyre going to use the sidelines, in the football metaphor of the books titlethey need to hold themselves accountable. But Haydens unwillingness to give an inch to any challenge shows why Congress, the press, and the public are the only ones who can keep the agencies honest.

Whats strange is that Hayden knows this. He knows that the intelligence world is isolated from the public, and that, like so many other institutions, it has lost Americans trust. He seems to understand that keeping the senior Republicans and Democrats on the intelligence committees informed while imposing a gag order on them is no longer enough to win citizens confidence. He goes so far as to call this realization Snowdens gift,  referring to him as the visible effect of a broad cultural shift that is redefining legitimate secrecy, necessary transparency, and what constitutes the consent of the governed.

This is ultimately why Hayden has come out of the shadows to write this still heavily shadowed book. He wants more openness, not out of any principled belief in government transparency but because its essential if his profession is going to survive. If we are going to conduct espionage in the future, he writes, we are going to have to make some changes in the relationship between the intelligence community and the public it serves. And, he adds, we also need to explain to those with whom we intend to be more open that with that will come some increased risk. It can be no other way. He isnt wrong to say so, or to point out the bad faith of the agencies detractors who want to have it both ways. After quoting passages from a congressional report critical of the N.S.A.s failure to do more to prevent 9/11, he adds, I mention them here only to point out that what then followed, NSAs Stellarwind program, was a logical response to an agreed issue and not the product of demented cryptologic minds, as some would later suggest. You dont have to be an admirer of warrantless wiretapping to acknowledge that it might have originated in an understandable panic about the intelligence failures that permitted the attacks to happen. Far easier to criticize intelligence agencies for not doing enough when [political lites] feel in danger, Hayden writes, while reserving the right to criticize those agencies for doing too much when they feel safe. The truth in this observation isnt weakened by the fact that Hayden repeats it elsewhere at least twice, nearly word for word.

Hayden isnt the mindless drone or sinister spy boss that his harshest detractors might believe. Hes a very imperfect bearer of a legitimate insight: that, if the American people and the intelligence world need each other, they cant afford to speak mutually unintelligible languages. Imperfect because he failed his own standard of openness, first while in governmenthe battled any serious oversight of the intelligence agencies most controversial programsand then again in this cheerful, overconfident account of his years there. George Tenet, in his more readable memoir, At the Center of the Storm, spends a lot of time on his mistakes, especially on Iraqs missing weapons of mass destruction. Hayden, by contrast, looks back and says, I could be accused of grading my own work, but I believe that despite our flaws, were actually pretty good at this spy stuff.

Hayden thinks that the answer to the intelligence communitys isolation and disarray is for leaders like him to come forth and explain their workwhich is what hes been doing since his retirement, in speeches and articles and debates (including one with Glenn Greenwald), and, now, in this memoir. He wants transparency, sort of (another official called it translucence), but on his own terms. That wont be enough, and perhaps nothing will be enough. In a sense, the more the spies say, the less the public will trust them, because its secrecy that gives them the mystique of knowledge. The relationship is a little like that between teen-agers and their parents. We expect the intelligence people to keep us safe, we resent them for their intrusions and their failures, and we need to believe that they know better than we do in spite of all the evidence to the contrary.

i toggle caption Richard Lautens/Toronto Star via Getty Images Richard Lautens/Toronto Star via Getty Images

Less than four months after it started accepting Syrian refugees, Canada says it has reached its goal of bringing in 25,000 people who have fled the raging civil war.

The initiative was a campaign promise by newly elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He personally welcomed the first group of refugees when they started arriving in December.

As NPR's Jackie Northam reports for our Newscast unit, ""initially, the government wanted to have all the refugees resettled by the end of last year, but logistical challenges  such as medical and security screenings  slowed the process.""

Now Canada has met its goal, and Jackie says private citizens and groups played a big role:

""Well, 15,000 of the refugees are being sponsored by the government, but what's remarkable is that about 10,000 are being resettled under a private sponsorship program, and it allows private citizens or groups to bring refugees into Canada. ... So we're seeing a lot of church groups and neighborhood groups, PTAs  things like that, all across Canada are stepping up to help in organizing. ""They have to make a one-year commitment to help the refugees get settled here, and that includes covering expenses, finding them housing and jobs, getting the kids settled in school. And even though it's a private sponsorship, the government will also help. They'll give the refugees a stipend, they'll get free health care and language lessons and the government will also pick up the cost of travel.""

Canada's immigration minister, John McCallum, says now that these Syrian have arrived, government efforts will shift to Phase 2: ""helping settled refugees find permanent living arrangements, jobs and to get them enrolled into language training for either French or English,"" according to the CBC. He adds that the program has cost about $522 million so far, which is ""under where the budget that we set.""

Here's more from the CBC report:

""In order to meet the Liberal government's campaign promise of bringing in 25,000 government-sponsored refugees, McCallum said, the federal government will have to settle another 10,000 Syrian refugees, plus some additional private refugees, before the end of the year.""

The new arrivals are settling in and beginning to find jobs. The Toronto Star newspaper says several dozen of them are working at two branches of a Middle Eastern grocery store in the Toronto area.

""This is a very good start. A first job is very important for someone who arrived alone with no money. Thank you for this opportunity. They are saving lives,"" says 26-year-old Marah Khanjian, from Aleppo, on her first day at work.

Jackie reported in December how the photo of a drowned Syrian toddler, face-down on a Turkish beach, became a major rallying point in Canada:

""Applications to sponsor Syrian refugees have been pouring in since early September, when a photo appeared of a lifeless 3-year-old boy whose body had been swept ashore at a Turkish beach. Alan Kurdi's parents had applied to Canada for asylum, but the request was turned down.""

This comes at a time when many countries, especially in Europe, are shutting borders or putting caps on the number of migrants they can take.

The U.S. has pledged to bring in 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year  which has faced pushback from some lawmakers. According to data from the Worldwide Refugee Processing System, 950 Syrian refugees have arrived in the U.S. so far this fiscal year. And 2,819 have arrived since Syria's civil war began five years ago.

McCallum said he thinks it's important for Canada to send a message to the world, according to the CBC. ""We are among the few countries who are saying, 'No, come on in, we want to welcome 25,000 quickly. ... It's important that we're helping 25,000 have a happy and productive life in Canada.""

"32","Carmike Cinemas stock rallies as analysts say time to buy is now.txt",282,513,26,"Carmike Cinemas Inc. blew past Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter.

The nations fourth-largest theater chain reported per-share earnings of 27 cents, or 41 cents on an adjusted basis, well above the FactSet consensus of 14 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter came in at $221 million, above the FactSet consensus of $211 million. Carmike CKEC, -0.36% shares closed up 14.8% on Tuesday.

All of the four major theater chainsRegal Entertainment Group RGC, +0.19% AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC, +2.39% and Cinemark Holdings Inc. CNK, +0.42% beat earnings expectations, thanks mainly to a record year for the domestic theatrical box office. But Carmike benefited also from its small town focus, being the main, or even only operator in a lot of markets in which it does business, according to B. Riley analyst Eric Wold.

Carmike was also the latest chain to adopt and see the benefits of a tax-on-top pricing strategy for concessions. Rather than an all-inclusive price of, for example, $5 for popcorn, the price stays the same but no longer includes tax, which is tacked on.

Carmike operates about 2,930 screens in the U.S. and reported admission per screen increased more than 15% in the fourth quarter, while ticket prices rose about 10% year-over-year. Attendance per screen saw a 5% bump.

Despite the tax-on-top strategy Carmike recently embraced, as well as ticket price inflation and more premium film formats, Carmike plans to raise the base ticket price by the low single digits in 2016. Raymond James analyst Joseph Hovorka views that as a potential risk.

Products and services in the leisure group are discretionary purchases, he wrote. A decline in consumer spending could negatively impact the performance of leisure stocks.

There were concerns in the film exhibitor sector that 2015s record year was going to create tough comparisons for the current year, which had led to a drop in share prices across the four major chains. But Wold said that now that the companies have beat expectations and stocks have recovered, it is time to buy. He believes 2016 could be another record year.

Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey said that looking even further to 2017, the film slate should continue to be strong.

We remain confident Hollywood movies as an entertainment option over the exhibitor market as a distribution medium will remain a relevant value solution for consumers over the long term, Hickey wrote.

Benchmark believes the recent selling of theater exhibitor stocks is mostly due to worry that 2016 box office would be hurt by a less compelling slate of new moves. Those concerns were exacerbated by sub-trends from the record 2015 record box office that suggested market growth was mainly driven by a few blockbuster films.

We are somewhat sheltered from greater valuation alarm in the near term based on our belief that the potential problematic box office environment in 2016 has been effectively discounted, and the general unpredictability of the box office and the underlying film slate as it relates to ultimate market performance in fiscal 2016 that could prove better than expected.

"33","Chicago homicides, shootings double over same period in 2015.txt",396,863,33,"CHICAGO (AP)  Homicides and shootings have doubled in Chicago so far this year compared with the same period in 2015, and police have seized fewer illegal guns  more possible signals that officers have become less aggressive in the aftermath of a shooting video released last fall.

Interim Police Superintendent John Escalante said Tuesday that he was so concerned about officers possibly holding back that he filmed a video for the entire department in which he encouraged them to do their jobs and assured them that a federal probe of the force was not aimed at individuals.

""We are aware that there is a concern among the rank and file about not wanting to be the next YouTube video that goes viral,"" Escalante said in the video before introducing a segment of his own to remind viewers ""why we took this job and swore this oath of office.""

The statistics come almost exactly three months after the city, on the orders of a judge, released the video of Jason Van Dyke, a white officer, firing 16 shots at Laquan McDonald, a black teen killed in 2014. Since that day, Van Dyke has been charged with murder, and Superintendent Garry McCarthy has been fired. The Department of Justice launched a civil rights probe of the police force, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel has sought to regain public trust in the department and his own leadership.

The crime figures offer a stark reminder that the nation's third-largest city is nowhere near shedding its reputation for frequent street violence. The vast majority of the bloodshed is happening in neighborhoods on the south and west sides, away from the Loop business district.

In the first two months of the year, authorities recorded 95 homicides, compared with 48 for the same period last year. Thus far, there have been 406 shootings, or more than twice as many as the 180 reported in the same two-month period in 2015.

View gallery FILE - In this July 7, 2014 file photo, Chicago police display some of the thousands of illegal fire 

The McDonald case raised concerns that officers, fearful of attracting negative attention, may be pulling back and becoming more passive. Quietly, officers say they are not going to take chances that might land them in legal trouble or threaten their jobs and pensions.

""I'm hearing that police are standing down because they're afraid what might happen to them, that when they get a call, they wait to see if someone answers it first,"" said the Rev. Michael Pfleger, a prominent Roman Catholic priest and activist on the South Side. ""I get really angry about that. If they are not going to do police work, they need to get out.""

Evidence of a pullback starts with an 80 percent decrease in the number of street stops that the officers have made since the first of the year. Escalante said he believes that decrease is largely tied to the fact that since the first of the year, officers have been required to fill out far lengthier forms than the brief ""contact cards"" they used to use.

The new forms were the result of changes in state law and an agreement between the department and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois that required Chicago police to more thoroughly document and monitor street stops.

Escalante said he hopes the newer and simpler forms the officers started filling out on Tuesday will help bring those numbers back up.

Officers' unwillingness to make as many stops as they once did might also explain the steep decline in gun seizures. Normally, the number of illegal guns recovered by police would climb with the number of homicides and shooting incidents, but the opposite has happened. So far this year, the total number of illegal guns seized by the department has fallen from 955 in the first two months of last year to 829 so far this year.

The decrease is particularly striking after the way McCarthy used to put seized weapons on display at news conferences. The displays were meant to show that his department was taking more guns off the streets than any other police force in the nation and to urge lawmakers to enact tougher gun laws.

The president of the union representing Chicago police officers did not respond Tuesday to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.

Escalante, who has not put guns on display as often, said he has not deemphasized gun seizures. He pointed to encouraging recent signs that include a 33 percent increase in gun arrests in the last four weeks and a 20 percent increase in the number of street stops officers have made in the last two weeks.

He said he is optimistic that the street-stop numbers will continue to climb with the new shorter form that replaces the two-page investigatory stop form officers have been filling out since Jan. 1.

"34","China and Australian housing_ Splurge at an end_.txt",372,835,49,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chinese buyers spent big in Sydney's property market in 2015, with harbour-side luxury apartments in high demand

Chinese buyers have helped drive huge price rises in Australia's property market, but Beijing is now trying to prevent its citizens from taking cash out of the country. Julian Lorkin investigates whether the boom is over.

Shanghai-based Australian real estate agent Scott Kirchner helped moneyed Chinese buyers snap up new Australian apartments and homes at a record rate last year.

Mr Kirchner, who speaks fluent Mandarin, is one of many Australian agents who run offices in Beijing and Shanghai hoping to reap profits from Chinese investors spending big offshore.

But increasing pressure on China's currency, the yuan, means Beijing is taking steps to stop money flowing out of the country. For agents like Mr Kirchner, the market may have passed its peak.

""Until now the rules were loose. You could liquidate investments on the Shanghai stock market and turn it into cash in Australia. The Chinese government wants to stop that,"" Mr Kirchner told the BBC.

According to Chinese law, individuals can take a maximum of $50,000 (A$69,800; 35,000) out of the country. Chinese banks that once looked away when investors transferred money to outside China are now scrupulously applying rules about the transfer of capital overseas.

This means fewer Chinese buyers can get enough money out of the country to buy expensive Australian real estate.

""Many of my customers are saying that they went to transfer funds overseas, and the bank refused,"" Mr Kirchner says. ""Now I tell Chinese buyers not to sign Australian contracts unless they already have their money in their hand - outside China.""

Economic woes

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China's share market has plunged since its peak in mid-2015

China's economy, the world's second-largest, appears to be slowing, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropping more than 40% since its peak in June.

Investors who sold at the share market's peak became yuan millionaires, but those who held on have lost much of their wealth.

""Many left it too late, and quite simply they don't have the cash any longer,"" says Mr Kirchner. ""In Sydney, every real estate agent was looking at China. Now, they are more cautious, which will cause problems for Australian developers.""

Last year Chinese buyers spent a record A$12bn on Australian property, boosting house prices at a time when locals were already feeling anxious about the rocketing cost of property.

But growth in house prices has now slowed in Australia. Between October and December 2015, Sydney house prices dropped by 3%, the biggest fall on record.

Investment banks like Macquarie are forecasting a 7% decline in 2016, and say a housing collapse could push Australia into recession.

Andrew Wilson, Domain's senior economist, said: ""The heady days of the boom are well over, and Australia is playing catch up with rest of the world in terms of low interest rates, and low growth.""

""China has been a very significant part of the market for the past few years, particularly for high rise apartments in Sydney,"" he said, adding that with growth forecasts of only 3% to 5% in 2016, there were questions over whether housing would remain attractive to investors.

Cause for optimism

Image copyright Julian Lorkin Image caption A Sydney real estate sign designed to attract Chinese buyers

Some analysts and agents are less pessimistic, arguing that Chinese investors are looking for safer havens than shares, and their investment in housing will prop up Australian house prices.

Only a small proportion of Chinese investors managed to liquidate their assets before the crash and clampdown. But a small percentage of China's share market is still a vast number of investors.

Tim Lawless, from real estate analysts Corelogic, said many Chinese investors had brought money to Australia already, as they had planned to buy property there for several years. Families could also team up to circumvent the US$50,000 foreign investment limit.

""That will sustain the property market,"" Mr Lawless said. ""Chinese who have cash here are still interested in Australian property.

""However, they are looking for areas that might still have growth, like Melbourne or the Gold Coast. Sydney is past its peak, but prices haven't fallen off a cliff. ""

Mr Wilson agreed, saying Chinese buyers were still active in Melbourne.

""Those who managed get out of China before the rout are looking for a safe haven which is resilient to any downturn. Chinese students are also buying, with the expectation that they and their parents will emigrate permanently in the next few years,"" he said.

LuLu Pallier, from Sotheby's Realty, markets luxurious mansions to wealthy buyers from mainland China.

She said the market for properties above A$5m remained strong.

""Buyers at this level already have their money in Australia, and want to put it somewhere safe,"" Ms Pallier said.

""Australia is very attractive. Compared with Chinese shares it is very stable. Confidence in Shanghai shares and property has evaporated."""
"35","Chris Rocks Oscars.txt",533,1029,48,"Imagine a world in which Seth MacFarlane or Neil Patrick Harris, or even Ellen DeGeneres, had been announced, back in October, as this years Oscar host. The outcry over the lack of diversity among the acting nominees would have been just as loud, but the response, at least during the ceremony itself, would have likely depended on a presenter here or there, or maybe a winneras was the case last year, when Common and John Legend bore the weight of the Selma snub with their victory for Best Original Song. The discussion of race in Hollywood would have been muted and marginalized, which would have been business as usual. But last night wasnt a normal Oscars broadcast. It was, lucky for us, Chris Rocks Oscars.

Im here at the Academy Awards, otherwise known as the White Peoples Choice Awards, Rock said, moments after taking the stage. By kismet or clairvoyance, the year of #OscarsSoWhite was also the year that one of Hollywoods most incisive observers of race was in the drivers seat, having wisely ignored calls to step down in protest. (How come theres only unemployed people that tell you to quit something? he cracked.) Rocks opening monologue was not only funnier than most in recent memory; it was stinging enough to ricochet through the rest of the evening, as the inevitable cavalcade of white presenters and winners took the mike. His most cutting line was probably this one: This year, in the In Memoriam package, its just going to be black people that were shot by the cops on their way to the movies. But the phrase that may linger the longest is sorority-racist. (As in, We like you, Rhonda, but youre not a Kappa.) It was an apt analogy for an industrythe one sitting captive in Rocks audiencethat likes to consider itself progressive, even lionhearted, while persisting in its blind spots.

It was clear from the outset that the #OscarsSoWhite campaign had seeped into the very thing it was made to criticize, just as #BlackLivesMatter has entered the political discoursehashtag activism made good. We want black actors to get the same opportunities as white actors, Rock said, echoing a line from Viola Daviss memorable Emmy speech last September: You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there. (Lets find Viola Davis something to win an Oscar for, yes?) And yet Rock isnt one to get on a high horse: he took time to rib celebrities who were boycotting the ceremony, like Jada Pinkett Smith (Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihannas pantiesI wasnt invited) and her husband (Its also not fair that Will was paid twenty million for Wild Wild West ).

The most successful Academy Awards hosts tend to be entertainers who are both insiders and outsidersoutside enough to take Hollywood down a peg but inside enough to know why the Oscars are worth caring about in the first place. Seth MacFarlane and David Letterman were too outside; Anne Hathaway and James Franco were too inside; Billy Crystal and Johnny Carson were just right. Rock is in that sweet spot, too. He wasnt there to let anyone off the hook, but he didnt try to alienate his audience, either. It was a tightrope that perhaps he alone could have walkedand, at times, he may have been too accommodating. After observing the illogic of dividing the acting categories by gender (Its not track and field), he lampooned the idea that red-carpet interviewers are no longer supposed to ask women what theyre wearing. Everythings not sexism. Everythings not racism, he assured us. But why give anyone room to rationalize a double standard? A little later in the night, Rock introduced some Asian children as the accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers who tally the votes. (If anyones upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone that was also made by these kids.) It was an unnecessary dump on an even more chronically underrepresented ethnic group, and plenty of people did take to their phones to point that out.

For the most part, though, Rock used his pulpit to merrily force the issue, from his post-commercial welcomes (Ah, were black!) and sly introductions of the presenters (shoulda-been-nominee Michael B. Jordan) to the excellent prerecorded segments. A sketch imagining black actors in nominated filmsWhoopi Goldberg with a mop in Joy; Tracy Morgan as the Danish girl; Rock as the marooned astronaut in The Martian (Can we just leave him up there?)was a winner. So was a compilation of Rocks man-on-the-street interviews with black moviegoers in Compton, which exposed the gulf between non-white audiences and the nominated films. (Asked about Bridge of Spies, one woman responded incredulously, Where are you getting these movies from?) An audience-participation bit about selling Girl Scout cookies was about as mild as DeGeneres ordering pizza, but it had the bonus of raising $65,243 for the Girl Scouts.

When Rock wasnt onstage, the controversy played out in quieter ways. The Academy President, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, gave a politician-like but firm speech about the diversity push she is leading among the membership. And Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, accepting the Best Director prize for The Revenant, made a hopeful speech about Hollywoods opportunity to liberate ourselves from all prejudice, which was jarringly played off by Ride of the Valkyries. Other moments powerfully highlighted other causes, from Lady Gagas anthem for survivors of sexual assault (with a surprise assist from Joe Biden) to Leonardo DiCaprios classy and non-preening speech on climate change. (Less inspiringly, Sam Smith, accepting for Best Original Song, wondered aloud if he was the first openly gay Oscar winner, which he wasnt.)

There was room for all these messages to buttress each other, the goal being a Hollywood thats ever more inclusive and enlightened. But this year will be remembered, rightly, for its thorny racial politics and for the way that Rock, probably as well as anyone could, held the industry to account on its biggest night. As the show ended, he signed off by saying, Black lives matter! And then: Brooklyn! Lest anyone think he meant a movie about an Irish immigrant, the credits rolled to the sound of Fight the Power."

Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton are eyeing an opportunity to pull away from their rivals on Super Tuesday, a delegate-rich dash across the country that could accelerate their march toward the general election.

Speaking at a Super Tuesday rally at his hometown in Miami, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio criticized the night's big winner among Republicans: Donald Trump. Rubio said he has begun ""to unmask the true nature"" of Trump, whom he called a ""con artist."" (March 1)

Hillary Clinton, triumphant in several states in a string of primaries known as Super Tuesday, turned her attention during her victory rally toward her possible Republican opponents. (March 1)

Donald Trump held a press conference Tuesday to thank supporters in what was a strong night for the GOP front-runner in the Super Tuesday contests. Despite heightened efforts by the GOP establishment to stop him, Trump says he is ""a unifier"". (March 1)

WASHINGTON (AP)  Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton swept through the South on Super Tuesday, with the front-runners claiming victory in their parties' primaries in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. Clinton also picked up wins in Virginia and Arkansas, while Trump carried the GOP contest in Massachusetts.

Super Tuesday marked the busiest day of the 2016 primaries, with the biggest single-day delegate haul up for grabs. With elections in every region of the country, the contests put a spotlight on candidates' strengths and weaknesses with a broad swath of American voters.

For Clinton and Trump, the voting marked an opportunity to begin pulling away from their rivals and charting a course toward the general election. Each entered Super Tuesday having won three of four early voting contests, and more strong showings could start putting the nominations out of reach for other contenders.

As Trump's victories piled up, he fired off ""thank you"" Twitter notes to the states that landed in his win column. The billionaire businessman scheduled a nighttime news conference at his swanky Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, eschewing the traditional election night rally.

Clinton was steadying herself after an unexpectedly strong challenge from Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator did carry his home state decisively on Tuesday, and told the crowd at a raucous victory party that he was ""so proud to bring Vermont values all across this country.""

Early exit polls underscored Sanders' continued weaknesses with black voters, a core part of the Democratic constituency. Clinton led with African-Americans, as well as both men and women, in Georgia and Virginia, according to surveys conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks.

Sanders continued to show strength with young voters, carrying the majority of those under the age of 30.

Democrats were voting in 11 states and American Samoa, with 865 delegates up for grabs. Republicans were voting in 11 states, with 595 delegates at stake.

The contests come at a turbulent time for the GOP, given Trump's strengths in the face of opposition from many party leaders. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz launched furious verbal attacks on the billionaire businessman in recent days, but some in the party establishment fear the anti-Trump campaign has come too late.

Trump's wins in the South were a blow to Cruz, who once saw the region as his opportunity to stake a claim to the nomination. Now Cruz's future hinges on a victory in his home state of Texas, the biggest prize of the day.

Rubio's goal was even more modest. He was seeking to stay competitive in the delegate count and hoping to pull off a win in his home state of Florida on March 15.

In a fundraising email to supporters, Rubio's campaign said the senator ""is not going to give up this fight  he'll do whatever it takes to stop Trump.""

However, Rubio was expected to face quick calls from Trump to drop out of the race if he failed to pick up any wins.

""He has to get out,"" Trump told Fox News earlier in the day. ""He hasn't won anything.""

Republicans spent months largely letting Trump go unchallenged, wrongly assuming that his populist appeal with voters would fizzle. Instead, he's appeared to only grow stronger, winning states and drawing broad support for some of his most controversial proposals.

In six of the states on Tuesday, large majorities of Republican voters said they supported a proposal to temporarily ban all non-citizen Muslims from entering the United States, an idea championed by Trump. Two-thirds of GOP voters in Texas, Virginia and Georgia, 7 in 10 in Tennessee, and nearly 8 in 10 in Alabama supported the proposal, according to the early exit polls.

Worries among Republicans appeared to grow after Trump briefly refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke during a television interview. Trump later said he had not understood the interviewer who first raised the question about Duke, and he did repudiate him.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday that anyone who wants to be the Republican presidential nominee must reject any racist group or individual.

""When I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country I will speak up. So today I want to be very clear about something: If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games,"" Ryan said.

The disarray among Republicans comes as Clinton appears to be tightening her grip on the Democratic field. In a sign of her growing confidence, the former secretary of state has increasingly turned her attention to Trump in recent days, casting herself as a civil alternative to the insults and bullying that have consumed the Republican race.

""What we can't let happen is the scapegoating, the flaming, the finger pointing that is going on the Republican side,"" she told voters in Springfield, Massachusetts, Monday. ""It really undermines our fabric as a nation.""

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump notched big wins across the South on Super Tuesday as they extended their leads for their party's nomination.

On the Republican side, Trump has won seven states: Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Vermont, Massachusetts and Georgia. Sen. Ted Cruz won his home state of Texas, eked out a surprise victory in Oklahoma and won the caucuses in Alaska. Florida Sen.

Trump: 'I'm A Unifier'

After a week in which many top Republicans had promised to stop the real estate mogul, Trump rolled through the biggest primary night yet.

But the boisterous billionaire was more subdued Tuesday night, trying to project a more presidential tone. Instead of his usual rousing victory parties, he held a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.

""Tonight is the best of all,"" Trump declared, touting his resounding victories as they continued to pile up.

He cast an eye toward the general election, promising he would bring the GOP together if he is the nominee and expand the party.

""I'm a unifier,"" Trump said. ""I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me.""

He also jabbed at the ""lightweight"" Rubio for having a ""tough night."" The Florida senator had hit Trump hard this week but ended up with little to show for it; he finally won in Minnesota late on Tuesday. Rubio's next closest state was Virginia, where he did well in the D.C. suburbs, but Trump still pulled out a victory, robbing him of a major coup.

Rubio had taken the stage earlier in Miami, exuding confidence nonetheless as the race moves to Florida in two weeks.

""We are going to send the message loud and clear ... that the presidency of the United States will never be held by a con artist,"" Rubio declared, echoing a hit against Trump he has frequently used this week.

But it was Cruz who used his wins in Texas and Oklahoma to frame the contest as a two-man race, calling for the other candidates to drop out.

""So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump's path to the nomination remains more likely, and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives and for the nation,"" Cruz said.

""And after tonight, we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat and that will beat Donald Trump,"" he argued.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich nearly pulled off an upset over Trump in Vermont, but would finish the night with no actual victories. His team is instead banking on a decisive victory in two weeks in his home state.

""Tonight, I can say that we have absolutely exceeded expectations,"" he told a crowd in Mississippi.

For Ben Carson, the results were even more bleak. His best showing of the evening was in Alabama, where he got 10 percent of the vote. But he, too, vowed to remain fighting.

""Millions of Americans plead with me to continue,"" he told a crowd in Baltimore. ""They know I am a citizen candidate, not a politician, who won't do what is expedient, but what is right.""

Clinton: 'This Country Belongs To All Of Us'

On the Democratic side, Clinton touted her strong finishes across the board, winning in states with diverse Democratic electorates.

""All across our country today, Democrats voted to break down barriers so we can all rise together,"" she declared.

Striking a noticeable contrast with Trump, her possible general election rival, she smiled as she said, ""I believe what we need in America today is more love and kindness.""

And she struck a populist tone, taking on one of Sanders' common themes as she told the crowd, ""this country belongs to all of us, not just those at the top.""

Sanders came out shortly after 7:30 p.m. ET from his campaign party in Vermont for what was expected to be a long night.

""By the end of tonight, we are going to win many hundreds of delegates,"" he told a roaring, adoring crowd in his home state.

""The people who know me best have voted so strongly to put me in the White House,"" Sanders boasted, declaring that his campaign ""is not just about electing a president; it is about transforming America."""
"39","Colombia ex-president Alvaro Uribe's brother arrested.txt",183,339,19,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Uribe's arrest prompted protests outside Medellin prosecutor's office

Police in the Colombian city of Medellin have arrested the brother of former president Alvaro Uribe on charges of murder and conspiracy.

Santiago Uribe has been accused of setting up a paramilitary group known as the Twelve Apostles in the 1990s.

It has been linked to the disappearances of dozens of left-wing rebels, drug addicts and criminals in the Antioquia region.

He denies any involvement with the notorious death squad.

The main witness in the case is a former police officer, Major Juan Carlos Meneses, who said that many of the crimes committed by the death squad were planned in the Uribe family's farm.

Uniformed paramilitaries began training at the La Carolina ranch, in the town of Yarumal, in 1994, said Maj Meneses.

'Peace with impunity'

Local police were paid to turn a blind eye to the activities of the death squad in the area, he added.

Alvaro Uribe became governor of Antioquia province around that time.

He went on to serve two terms as president (2002-2010) and is now a senator in opposition to President Juan Manuel Santos.

Image copyright AP Image caption Alvaro Uribe's father was killed by the Farc in 1983 during a botched kidnapping attempt

Mr Meneses says he has no evidence connecting the former president to the paramilitary group.

Alvaro Uribe has been very vocal in his criticism of the peace negotiations Mr Santos has been holding with the Farc since November 2012.

""Peace with impunity is unsustainable, it is a bad precedent, a bad example,"" he told journalists in Miami in January.

The two sides are expected to sign a peace accord later this month.

Supporters of the former president have accused the government of inflicting political persecution on the opposition.

""The infamous detention of the brother of former President Alvaro Uribe darkens the atmosphere, restricts civil liberties and leaves the opposition without guarantees,"" said Senator Paloma Valencia.

Santiago Uribe, a cattle rancher, has not pursued a political career."
"40","Courting Business.txt",433,895,45,"In Antonin Scalias thirty years on the Supreme Court, his name became a byword for social conservatism. And when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the Senate would refuse to consider any replacement President Obama nominates it was natural that opponents of same-sex marriage and abortion were relieved. Yet Scalias death will have only a limited impact on the culture wars, because regarding many social issues he was already in the minority on the Court. But there is one area where the question of his replacement has huge consequences: business. As a member of the Courts conservative majority, Scalia played a key role in moving American law in a more corporate-friendly direction. Now that majority is gone, and a huge amount rides on what happens next.

Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court has not gone as far in limiting government power over the marketplace as many conservatives would have liked. But the Roberts Court has been the most pro-business of any since the Second World War, according to a paper by the law professors Lee Epstein and William Landes and Judge Richard Posner that looked at decisions from 1946 to 2011. Its five sitting conservatives, including Scalia, ranked among the ten most business-friendly Justices of that period. The Roberts Court hasnt just made a lot of pro-business rulings. It has taken a higher percentage of cases brought by businesses than previous courts, and it has handed down far-reaching decisions that have remade corporate regulation and law. In Citizens United, it famously ruled that corporations had free-speech rights and that many restrictions on corporate spending in elections were therefore unconstitutional. It has overturned long-standing antitrust restrictions. It has limited liability for corporate fraud and made it harder for workers to successfully sue for age and gender discrimination. It has made suing businesses and governments more difficult, especially in class-action suits.

This is no accident. Since the Reagan Administration, Republican Presidents have filled the Court with Justices steeped in the ideology of the conservative legal movement. As Brian Fitzpatrick, a law professor at Vanderbilt who once clerked for Scalia, told me, Conservative Justices start from a world view that says we have too much litigation in general and its a sap on the economy. Conservative nominees to the Court have been far more worried about government overreach than about corporate misbehavior. They have been skeptical of the use of class-action suits to achieve social goals or enforce regulations. And, once corporations recognized that the Court was predisposed to favor their interests, they began pursuing those interests more aggressively. As the legendary N.Y.U. law professor Arthur R. Miller told me, The business community smelled blood and went after it. Most notably, the Chamber of Commerce has become assiduous in pushing corporate cases to the Court.

A few of these cases have received a lot of attention, but the most consequential work of the Roberts Court in protecting corporate rights has been in cases that have gone mostly unnoticed, including a pair (A.T. & T. v. Concepcion and American Express v. Italian Colors) in which Scalia wrote the majority opinion. In these cases, both of which turned on an interpretation of a once obscure 1925 law, the Court ruled that companies could require customers to give up their right to sue in open court, with disputes to be settled by a private arbitrator instead. These cases dont get peoples attention the way things like abortion and same-sex marriage do, Miller said. But, if the decisions stand, Fitzpatrick argues, they have the potential to literally wipe out the class-action lawsuit.

That might not sound like a bad thingwere always hearing that Americans are too litigiousbut, in an era when regulators are routinely falling down on the job, lawsuits play a crucial role in deterring corporate misbehavior. Miller calls them a private enforcement of public policies. And when it comes to big corporations class-action suits are often the only kind that make any economic sense. If every individual defrauded by a company loses fifty dollars, the collective harm can be immense, but its not worthwhile for any single victim or lawyer to bother. Fitzpatrick says that obstacles to filing class-action lawsuits make it more likely that companies will not be held accountable for hurting people, for cheating people, for defrauding people, for discriminating against people. In that sense, the battle over access to the courtroom is, as Miller puts it, a kind of class conflict between ordinary individuals and corporate power. And in that conflict theres no question which side Scalia was on.

Of course, theres no guarantee that his death will change things. But many of the Roberts Courts most important business cases were decided by a 54 margin, with the five conservative Justices voting as a bloc. And, as Fitzpatrick points out, Scalia has done more than any other justice in making it difficult for consumers and employees to bring class-action suits. So his absence alone may make a difference. There have already been signs of this: just last week, Dow Chemical settled a major class-action suit, saying that Scalias death increased the chances of unfavorable outcomes for business. Its unlikely that Scalia will be replaced anytime soon. But lets hope that, when a successor is finally appointed, it is someone willing to give ordinary citizens the day in court that Scalia worked so hard to deny them. "

The California-based photographer David Pace first travelled to the village of Bereba, in the French-speaking West African country Burkina Faso, in 2007, to photograph the library that a colleague had helped to establish there through an N.G.O. Inspired by the experience, he began plotting a second trip before his plane even touched back down in the United States. He returned to Bereba eleven months later, and each year since, and has continued to document the rhythms and activities of daily village lifefarmers returning from working in their fields, tailors in the market, women at work in their compounds.

On Friday nights, from his house in Bereba, Pace could hear the sound of African pop music coming from the village edge, where the outdoor club Le Cotonnier hosts weekly d.j. dance parties. The clubs sound system is powered by a gas generator; the dance floor is a concrete slab. The only light comes from a pair of dim fluorescent bulbs and the flashlights that many club-goers carry with them. Pace became a regular at Le Cotonnier, and his photographs of the weekly parties became his series Friday Night. He told us: The atmosphere is electric. Everyone moves with amazing athleticism and grace. I see flashes of James Brown and Michael Jackson combined with echoes of traditional ritual dances. My strobe elicits a joyous reaction. It encourages the dancers and propels the revelry. I photograph within this maelstrom of activity, more as a participant than as an observer."

"48","Doctors love prescribing probiotics, even though no one knows if they actually work.txt",227,410,22,"Probiotics: so hot right now.

Recent reports have linked probiotics, or good bacteria, to everything from fighting liver cancer to reversing childhood malnutrition to getting rid of yeast infections. But probiotics have not been proven effective at any of these things. That liver-cancer-fighting study was done on mice, as were two out of the three malnutrition studies cited at that link. And despite the pervasive gynecology advice to eat more yogurt, there has yet to be any conclusive evidence that it helps women with that pesky vaginal itch.

Doctors in US hospitals, it turns out, are also big fans of these almost magical-sounding bacteria: Between 2006 and 2012, probiotic use in hospitals nearly tripled, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published in the American Journal of Infection Control. The 2.9-fold increase in probiotic use in hospitals, the study warns, comes despite inadequate evidence to support their use.

Looking at approximately 1 million hospitalizations at 139 hospitals in 2012, the CDC researchers found that probiotics were prescribed in 2.6% of casesapproximately 52,000compared to 2006, when it was only 1.0%. (The CDC study looked at oral probiotics only, not the increasingly popular fecal transplants.)

Outside of hospitals theres been a similar increase in the use of probiotics, the CDC notes, citing other studies. In a 2007 survey, 0.4% of US adults reported taking probiotics in the prior 30 days; in 2012, that went up to 1.6%.

Probiotics are often prescribed with antibiotics, lead researcher Sarah Yi told Quartz. It makes sense if you wipe out the bacteria in your intestinal tract [with the antibiotics], why not replace them? she said.

As rational as that thinking sounds, though, the data dont necessarily support it, she says. While some systematic reviews find that certain kinds of probiotic treatment help with specific illnesses, its still not conclusiveand doctors dont necessarily prescribe in line with those reviews. Some use is in accordance with evidence, Yi says, but not all of it.

While most people view probiotics as benign at worst, its not always that simple. Most hospitalized patients would not be at high risk for infection related to probiotics, Yi says, but there would be patients that could be, especially in the ICU. That includes people with weak immune systems, such as those waiting for an organ transplant.

Probiotics are undoubtedly a promising new area for research. But most of that research has yet to be done."

"50","Donald Trump and the Ku Klux Klan_ A History.txt",580,1341,63,"For months, as Donald Trump developed his political repertoire, he adopted an uncharacteristic reply for questions about fascism and the Ku Klux Klan: silence, or something close to it.

He used the technique as early as last August, when his opponents, and the press, still generally regarded him as a summer amusement. On August 26th, the Bloomberg Television anchor John Heilemann brought up David Duke, the former Klan Grand Wizard, who had said that Trump was the best of the lot in the 2016 campaign. Trump replied that he had no idea who Duke was. Heilemann asked if Trump would repudiate Dukes endorsement. Sure, Trump said, if that would make you feel better, I would certainly repudiate. I dont know anything about him. Changing tack, Heilemann pressed Trump about an article in this magazine, which described Trumps broad support among neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and other members of the far right who were drawn in by his comments about Mexicans. Trump maintained a posture of indifference. Honestly, John, Id have to read the story. A lot of people like me. The interview moved on to other topics.

It should be noted that Trumps unfamiliarity with Duke is a recent condition. In 2000, Trump issued a statement that he was no longer considering a run for President with the backing of the Reform Party, partly because it now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke.

Throughout last fall and into the winter, Trump continued to accumulate support among white nationalists. In November, on a weekend in which he said that a black protester, at a rally in Alabama, deserved to be roughed up, Trump retweeted a graphic composed of false racist statistics on crime; the graphic, it was discovered, originated from a neo-Nazi account that used as its profile image a variation on the swastika. In January, he retweeted the account @WhiteGenocideTM, which identified its location as Jewmerica. Shortly before the Iowa caucuses, a pro-Trump robocall featured several white supremacists, including the author Jared Taylor, who told voters, We dont need Muslims. We need smart, well-educated white people. Each time Trump was asked on Twitter about his white nationalist supporters, the candidate, who is ready to respond, day or night, to critics of his debating style or his golf courses, simply ignored the question.

Only under special circumstances did Trump summon a forceful response on matters of the Klan: in January, BoingBoing unearthed a newspaper report from 1927 on the arraignment of a man with the name and address of Donald Trumps father; the story was about attendees of a Klan rally who fought with police, though it wasnt clear from the story why the Trump in the piece was arrested. Asked about it, Donald Trump denied that his father had had any connection to a Klan rally. Its a completely false, ridiculous story. He was never there! It never happened. Never took place.

But recently, as Trumps campaign has received much belated closer scrutiny, his reliable approach to the Klan problem has faltered. On Thursday, Duke offered his strongest support for the candidate yet, telling radio listeners that a vote for one of Trumps rivals would be treason to your heritage. The next day, when Trump had hoped to focus on his endorsement by Governor Chris Christie, of New Jersey, a reporter shouted a question about Dukes embrace, and Trump said, David Duke endorsed me? O.K., all right, I disavow. O.K.? For the moment, it worked, and the press conference moved on. Christie, in fact, bore the brunt of the Duke association: he appeared on the front page of the Daily News on Saturday, as the MAN WITH A KLAN, with his picture beside a group of hooded Klansmen. In a different spirit, the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi news site that long ago endorsed Trump, awarded Christie the title Heroic Deputy. (Christies overnight evolution from trashing Trump to obeying him repulsed even the political class, a group that is usually more forgiving of self-rationalization. The technology executive Meg Whitman, who had been one of Christies top backers, called his alliance with Trump an astonishing display of political opportunism, and asked Christies donors and supporters to reject the governor and Donald Trump outright.)

Over the weekend, Trumps purported indifference to support from white supremacists and fascists became an inescapable problem. He had retweeted a Mussolini quote from @ilduce2016 (which, it turned out, was an account created by Gawker to trap Trump)It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheepand, when asked, on NBC, if he wanted to associate himself with Mussolini, he said that he wanted to be associated with interesting quotes. He added, Mussolini was Mussolini. . . . What difference does it make? On CNN, Jake Tapper pressed him about David Duke, and Trump, seeming to forget that he had given a one-line disavowal, reverted to a position of theatrical incomprehension: Just so you understand, I dont know anything about David Duke, O.K.? Tapper asked three times if Trump would denounce the Klans support, and each time Trump declined. I dont know anything about what youre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists, he said. So I dont know. I dont knowdid he endorse me, or whats going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.

By Monday, less than twenty-four hours before primary voting on Super Tuesday, his non-answers about the Klan were creating a crisis, and Trump introduced a new explanation: audio trouble. Im sitting in a house in Florida with a very bad earpiece that they gave me, and you could hardly hear what he was saying, he said on the Today show. But what I heard was various groups, and I dont mind disavowing anybody, and I disavowed David Duke and I disavowed him the day before at a major news conference, which is surprising because he was at the major news conference, CNN was at the major news conference, and they heard me very easily disavow David Duke.

There may be no better measure of the depravity of this campaign season than the realization that its not clear whether Trumps overt appreciation for fascism, and his sustained salute to American racists, will have a positive or negative effect on his campaign. For now, his opponents are rejoicing. Marco Rubio, the Florida senator, pronounced him unelectable. Governor John Kasich, of Ohio, called Trumps comments just horrific. But it is by now a truism to note that Trump has survived pratfalls that other politicians have not. A surprisingly large portion of Americans believed him when he pushed a racist campaign denying the birthplace of Barack Obama; a comparably chilling portion of Americans were attracted when he called Mexicans rapists. By the end of the day on Sunday, he had received the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, the first sitting senator officially to line up with Trump. Sessions was not likely to be bothered by Trumps flirtations with the Klan. In 1986, he was rejected from a federal judgeship after saying that he thought the Klan was O.K. until I learned they smoked pot.

In the weeks to come, Trump is virtually guaranteed to accumulate additional endorsements from politicians like Christie and Sessions, who have divined their interests in drafting behind the strongest candidate for the Republican nomination. Whether driven by fear of irrelevance or attracted by the special benefits of being an early adopter, Christie seemed compelled to do it, and now the remnant of his political reputation is going from a solid to a gas. But the true obscenity of his decision, and those of other Trumpists, may take years to be fully appreciated. In an editorial last week, the Washington Post declared that history will not look kindly on GOP leaders who fail to do everything in their power to prevent a bullying demagogue from becoming their standard-bearer. Thats true, but history will judge even more harshly those who stand with Trump now that it is indefensibly clear with whom they are standing."
"51","Donald Trump Is Transforming the G.O.P. Into a Populist, Nativist Party.txt",550,1111,51,"Ever since last Thursday nights televised G.O.P. debate, the Republican primary race has turned into a demolition derby. Marco Rubio, who for a long time portrayed himself as the young, positive, Kennedyesque candidate in the race, is now calling Donald Trump a con artist and throwing every other insult at the front-runner that he can, including, over the weekend, a thinly veiled penis-size joke. Trump, for his part, has been berating Little Marco at every opportunity, labelling him a choke artist who is too unmanly to be President. Meanwhile, Ted Cruz is attacking both Trump and Rubio.

If youve been following all of this bile in real time, on social media, it is easy to miss the larger reality that it reflects. With Trump in a strong position to win the primary, Republicans are engaged in a bitter battle not just about who will represent them in November, but about the broader nature of their party. For the past forty years, the G.O.P. has been an uneasy alliance of social conservatives, free-market conservatives, and corporate interest groups, with the latter largely dictating economic policy. Trump has been drawing on a base of alienated white working-class and middle-class voters, seeking to remake the G.O.P. into a more populist, nativist, avowedly protectionist, and semi-isolationist party that is skeptical of immigration, free trade, and military interventionism.

If he were to succeed in this quest, he would arguably be the most consequential Republican since Ronald Reagan, in part by challenging some aspects of Reagans legacy. Of course, Trumps own bequest could well up being ruinous: if he does get the nomination, his racism, xenophobia, and megalomania would hopefully condemn the G.O.P. to a massive defeat. But even then, the party establishment, in picking up the pieces, would have to deal with the issues and fault lines that his candidacy has exposed.

To transform a political party, you need a clear message, a broad electoral base, and allies within the existing power structure. Trump now has all three of these things. As Ive pointed out before, his claim that Washington is broken and can only be fixed by an outsider resonates with many Americans, and not just arch-conservatives. So does his demagoguery about illegal immigrants and the supposed threat that Muslims present. What is perhaps more surprising, at least to Washington-based conservatives, is how many Republicans are also embracing Trumps populist lines on ending free trade, protecting Social Security, and providing basic health care.

Evidently, many ordinary G.O.P. voters are less enthusiastic about Ayn Rands view of the world than are corporate-funded politicians and corporate-funded entities such as the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Cato Institute. A similar pattern seems to apply to social issues. Given Trumps history of support for abortion rights and the fact that he has been married three times, you might think he would be anathema to Christian evangelicals. But Trumpism is sweeping through the Deep South, which suggests that many evangelicals are willing to look past the candidates New York values.

Having scored large victories in New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, Trump now looks set to win at least eight of the eleven states that will hold contested Republican votes on Super Tuesday: Alaska, Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Vermont, and Virginia. And he could easily win two more states, Arkansas and Minnesota, that the polls suggest are a bit tighter. The only state that looks to be beyond him is Texas, where surveys show Cruz leading. (Ironically, that could be good news for Trump. If Cruz wins in Texas, he will probably stay in the race, making it harder for anybody to consolidate the non-Trump vote.)

If Trump does as well as expected, it would still be mathematically possible for someone else to emerge as the candidate. But the window of opportunity would be closing fast. During the next two weeks, Republican primaries or caucuses will be held in eight more statesHawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, and Mississippiplus Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. In almost all of these places, Trump appears to be leading. (In Michigan, for example, he is twenty points up.) If he comes out ahead in most, or all, of these places, he would be in position to deliver the final blow on March 15th, by coming out on top in the winner-takes-all state of Florida, and in two other delegate-rich states, Illinois (which is also winner-take-all) and North Carolina.

Until recently, Trumps opponents, and skeptical conservative commentators, consoled themselves with the thought that, despite the enthusiasm of his core supporters, he would struggle to get more than a third of the Republican vote. Now this low ceiling theory looks tattered. In Nevada, Trump received almost forty-six per cent of the votes cast. Today, CNN published a national poll showing that forty-nine per cent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents backed him. (Rubio was in second place, with sixteen per cent of the vote, and Cruz was in third, with fifteen per cent.)

In light of these sorts of numbers, it is hardly surprising that some elected Republicans are starting to hop aboard the Trump bus. Their points of origin are telling. On Friday, Chris Christie, a representative of the Partys somewhat-less-conservative wing, endorsed Trump. And on Sunday Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, one of the most influential ultra-conservatives in the Party, did likewise.

Given the fact that Christie was bashing Trump on the stump just a few weeks ago, his endorsement was the most dramatic (and heavily covered) of the two. It indicated that Trump, ultimately, may end up getting the backing of many coastal Republicans and business interests, who arent particularly ideological. But in terms of votes in the Republican primaries, and the future direction of the party, it is the Sessions endorsement that probably matters most. A lifelong Republican whom Reagan nominated to a federal judgeship in 1986, his bona fides as a conservative and party loyalist are unquestioned.

This isnt a campaign, this is a movement, Sessions (whose backing Cruz had reportedly been desperately seeking) said to a crowd estimated at about thirty thousand, in Madison, Alabama. He identified immigration and trade as the key issues that had brought him to Trumps side. Nobody is perfect, Sessions went on. We cant have everything, can we, Mr. Trump? But I can tell you one thing . . . at this time in American history, we need to make America great again. With that, Sessions took out one of those red Trump baseball capswhich are stitched together by a Los Angeles firm that employs lots of Mexican immigrantsand put it on, to huge cheers. Heading into Super Tuesday, Trump appears to be unstoppable."
"52","Donald Trump, David Duke, and the Soccer Fields of Louisiana.txt",477,1114,51,"Growing up in New Orleans, I was always the only black kid, or one of two, on the school soccer team. While I was always conscious of this status, what took precedent was my unfettered love of the game. I loved the way that my feet sunk into the thick soil of our high-school field; how the low-cut grass, with its endless cascade of small, emerald blades, was a place where I felt more like myself than anywhere else; how celebrating with your team after a goal was an unparalleled sort of ecstasy.

I dont get a chance to play as often as Id like anymore. What was once dancing gracefully around defenders has become tripping over a pair of feet that fail to follow directions as they once did. But I will always remember the moments when the game made me feel most at ease, just as I will always remember the moments in which it was clear that the soccer field could not shield me from what existed beyond it.

In 1991, when I was three years old and still a few years from officially setting foot on a field, David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard, rose to national prominence during an infamous runoff to become the governor of my home state. Duke was known for his open hatred of many groups, including African-Americans. He was quoted as having said, White people dont need a law against rape, but if you fill this room up with your normal black bucks, you would, because niggers are basically primitive animals. Duke lost the election, but won fifty-five per cent of the white vote.

Last week, David Duke came out in support of Donald Trumps candidacy, stating, Voting against Donald Trump, at this point, is really treason to your heritage. On Sunday, when asked if he would condemn Duke and the Klan, Trump failed to give an unequivocal yes, instead suggesting that he did not know who Duke was and that he had to do research on the organization. The next day, Trump said that he had misheard the question and had already disavowed Duke, but his response on Sunday spoke for itself. It was the sort of silence I had known throughout my life.

When I was a sophomore at Benjamin Franklin, a magnet high school on the campus of the University of New Orleans, we had an early-stage play-off game against Dutchtown High School, of Geismar, Louisiana. Geismar is a predominantly white town in southeast Louisiana, with about seven thousand people and a large petrochemical plant. The town is about twenty miles south of Louisiana State University, where, in 1970, a young David Duke formed a student group called the White Youth Alliance, a campus affiliate of the National Socialist White Peoples Party.

It was standard for me to be not just the only black person on my team but the only one on the field. Such was the case as we lined up to begin that game. We stood in our burnt-orange jerseys, theirs a deep purple, our uniforms matching the color of the early-evening horizon, as kick-off began.

We won the game comfortably, moving on to a season that eventually culminated in winning the state championship. It was one of my better performances, the kind of game where you feel yourself to be indomitable. I had the sense that I could score every time I touched the ball.

After the game, my teammates and I sauntered over to the sidelines, where our parents and classmates were waiting. Some of them looked deeply unsettled. We didnt spend much time celebrating the victory; instead, we were rushed back to the parking lot and told that we should leave quickly. No one wanted to stay there longer than was absolutely necessary.

Apparently, after I made a run that beat several defenders before crossing the ball to a teammate for an assist on a goal, someone in Dutchtowns section of the stands shouted, Take that nigger out.

I did not hear it from the field, but the slur came from directly behind my parents, who, along with many others, quickly turned to see who had made the remark. There was a commotion, and my father began moving in the direction the comment came from, wanting to demonstrate that he had heard what had been said and was unwilling to let it go unacknowledged. This was not new to him. He had told me stories about being a student at the University of Florida and, on more than one occasion, being called nigger by drunken frat boys as he and his friends walked across the quad. They only talked like that when they could hide behind a crowd, he said.

After the game, no one from Dutchtown came and said anything to us. No one apologized to my parents. No one apologized to me. Im not sure that I expected them to. Perhaps they felt it wasnt their responsibility to say anything about something that they didnt say themselves. Perhaps they thought that, since it did not come directly from their mouths, they did not need to disavow the remarks.

After being harangued for his failure to quickly and explicitly disavow David Duke, Trump blamed his response on a very bad earpiece. The idea was that he had not fully heard Dukes name.

Trump, of course, has said that he wants a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. He has said, of Mexican immigrants, Theyre bringing drugs, theyre bringing crime, theyre rapists.

When I hear Trump make these remarks, I find myself less concerned with him than with the crowds that explode in jubilance at his eventsand with the poll numbers that rise with each offensive comment. How many of those in the crowd would ever say these things themselves? How many of those people, lost in the sea of faces, do not believe themselves to be full participants in bigotry? I wonder how many of those responding to these polls are people I have worked with, gone to school with, or played soccer with.

When I ask my mother about that game, years later, she remembers, more than anything, how quickly we left, fearing that the person who wanted me to be taken out could still be somewhere in the stands or in the parking lot. Being black in Louisiana meant that you werent going to wait to find out.

When I think back on that game, I do not remember the person who said, Take that nigger out. I remember all of the people who might have let it happen and then said it wasnt their fault."
"53","Dow Rises Nearly 350 Points on Upbeat Data.txt",395,699,48,"Major U.S. stock indexes surged to their highest levels in nearly two months Tuesday on signs of improvement in the U.S. economy.

The broad rally was led by financial and technology shares, which fell sharply earlier this year as investors fretted about collateral damage from weak global growth, slumping corporate profits and low oil prices.

A handful of data across several sectors helped restore some confidence in the U.S. economy Tuesday, analysts and investors said.

A gauge of the troubled manufacturing sector rose last month to its best reading since September, U.S. auto sales climbed and U.S. construction spending rose in January. A rally in oil prices added to the updraft.

The real world is not as bad as the market made it seem recently, said Jason Hans, a portfolio manager at BMO Global Asset Management. His team bought auto and industrial stocks on Tuesday, he said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 348.58 points, or 2.1%, to 16865.08, while the S&P 500 added 46.12 points, or 2.4%, to 1978.35. For both indexes, it was their highest closing levels since Jan. 6 and their biggest one-day gains since Jan. 29. The Nasdaq Composite rose 131.65 points, or 2.9%, to 4689.60, its largest gain since Aug. 26.

Investors sold assets perceived as havens, driving up the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 1.835%, its highest since Feb. 5, compared with 1.740% Monday. Gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,230.30 an ounce. The dollar gained 1.2% against Japans yen to 114.00.

In another reflection of the renewed optimism, expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this year have increased.

Federal-funds futures, used by investors and traders to place bets on central-bank policy, showed a 60% likelihood of a rate increase from the Fed at its December policy meeting, according to data from CME Group. The probability was 12% a month ago.

Financial stocks rallied Tuesday, leading the S&P 500 with a 3.5% gain. Rising interest rates should help banks because they tend to widen the difference between the interest that banks charge on loans and what they pay for deposits.

J.P. Morgan Chase JPM -0.13 % was the biggest gainer in the Dow, rising $2.90, or 5.2%, to $59.20. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of large U.S. commercial lenders rose 4.6%.

Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices rose 1.9% to $34.40 a barrel, their highest settlement value since Jan. 5, after Russias energy minister said a critical mass of oil-producing countries agreed to freeze oil output, state news agency TASS reported.

However, Tuesdays stock-market rally wasnt enough to quash the rocky start to 2016.

U.S. economic data has been pretty darn good. I wouldnt necessarily say strong, said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. The market can move up quite a bit before it goes positive for the year.

The S&P 500 and the Dow industrials are both down 3.2% so far in 2016.

Some analysts and investors said the factors that unsettled the markets earlier this year havent fully faded.

Its not going be a sharp rebound, said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. Investors should be prepared for a lot more volatility until a lot more of these concerns are resolved.

SPX Leaders and Laggards - 1 Day

Chinese manufacturing activity fell to its lowest level in more than four years, data showed Tuesday, as the worlds second-largest economy continues to struggle.

Nevertheless, global stocks have steadied over the past few weeks. Analysts said recent improvements in U.S. economic data and hopes for fresh stimulus from the European Central Bank have boosted sentiment. Were not in the same place we were in two months ago, said Thushka Maharaj, global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.4% Tuesday. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.7% and Japans Nikkei Stock Average added 0.4%.

"54","DreamsWorks Animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg 'fantasizes' about merger with Paramount Pictures.txt",256,467,26,"Its a Hollywood marriage DreamWorks Animation Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg said he fantasizes about: the merging of the animation studio with Paramount Pictures.

Katzenberg floated the idea Tuesday while speaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in San Francisco. He brushed aside notions that hed be interested in buying a minority stake in Paramount Pictures, instead contemplating the idea of a full merger of the two studios.

I could imagine that with a good financial partner coming with us, putting the assets of Paramount and DreamWorks together could be extremely valuable, and we could bring a lot to that business, Katzenberg said.

The conjecture comes as Viacom-owned Paramount Pictures, which is behind such films as Star Trek and Mission Impossible, has said it is considering bringing in an equity partner.

Im not spending a lot of time tactically thinking about it, Katzenberg said. Do I fantasize about it though? Yeah. I wouldnt do it if I didnt have a financial partner to come along and put a big piece of capital into that. I would want to do it in a way that was a good thing for the company and for shareholders, not just because it would be a good thing to have.

A Paramount spokesperson said the studio had no comment.

Katzenberg cut his teeth at Paramount, eventually becoming president of production. And Paramount served as a distribution partner for DreamWorks Animation movies for seven years until 2013, when the studio struck a deal with Twentieth Century Fox.

Like Paramount, DreamWorks has confronted its own share of challenges. Last year, the company overhauled its film operations in the wake of a series of box-office flops, including Turbo and Penguins of Madagascar, and reduced its output to only two films a year. The company cut 500 jobs and closed its Redwood City, Calif., animation studio.

Katzenberg, echoing sentiments he made to investors when the company posted its fourth-quarter results last week, said the next 12 to 18 months for DreamWorks would be choppy as it resets itself.

"55","Dry spell ate away at snowpack of drought-ridden California.txt",189,323,18,"ECHO SUMMIT, Calif. (AP)  An unwelcome three-week winter dry spell left the California snowpack at just 83 percent of average, a setback for the state as it tries to break out of record drought, state snow surveyors found Tuesday.

In an icy meadow in California's central Sierra Nevada, state surveyor Frank Gehrke plunged poles into snowbanks, measuring how much snow was lost to a February with record warm temperatures and little rain.

Californians depend on snowfall for a third of their water and have hoped this year's strong El Nino system would deliver heavy snow and rain.

After a wet December and January, however, sunshine and blue skies returned, bringing temperatures in the 90s to Southern California last month.

The year had a ""very good start, and then ... February just did not come through,' Gehrke said.

Gehrke's measuring site showed snowpack at 105 percent of average, compared to 130 percent at the same spot the month before.

View gallery Frank Gehrke, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program for the Department of Water R 

Statewide, snowpack Tuesday was at 83 percent of normal, officials said.

California last year marked its driest four-year spell on record, leading Gov. Jerry Brown last April to order mandatory 25 percent water conservation for cities and towns. The conservation order remains in effect.

Officials say bringing the state out of drought would require snowpack at 150 percent of average by April 1.

December, January and February typically are the wettest months in California. However, late spring storm patterns dubbed ""March Miracles"" helped ease dry spells in 1991 and 1995, state Department of Water Resources officials noted.

Californians can still hope for such a miracle this week, when changing weather patterns promise to send a series of storms over the state, the National Weather Service said.

Forecasters expect as much as 7 inches of rain in Northern California in the coming days and heavy snow in the mountains."
"56","Elena Kagans dissent in Lockhart v. United States shows shes Scalias successor as the best writer on the Supreme Court..txt",559,1280,60,"Paul Morigi/Getty Images

When Justice Clarence Thomas broke his decade-long silence on Monday to defend the Second Amendment rights of domestic abusers, court-watchers speculated that the famously reticent justice might step up to fill the conservative vacuum created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Thomas may well position himself as the right flanks anchor, and perhaps even its bomb-thrower. But a decision handed down on Tuesday suggests that Scalias other legacyhis dedication to interpreting statutes in accordance with their text and plain meaningwill be taken up by a frequent ideological opponent: Justice Elena Kagan.

Mark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.

Tuesdays decision in the case Lockhart v. United States divided the court in an unusual 62 scramble: Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing for the majority (joined by the conservatives and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg), Kagan writing for the dissent (joined by Justice Stephen Breyer). You can bet that Scalia had previously signed onto Kagans dissent. Her arguments neatly track his questions at oral arguments, and her opinion is written in a delightfully Scalian manner that seems calculated to draw his vote.

Lockhart was, in one sense, a case about grammar. At issue was a sloppily written federal law, a statute creating mandatory minimums for child pornographers. Under that statute, anybody caught possessing child pornography is subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence if he has a prior state court conviction relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward. Lower courts split on a crucial question: Does the phrase involving a minor or ward apply to all three crimes, or does it just relate to an abusive sexual conduct conviction? The more lenient interpretation sees involving a minor or ward as a limiting clause, restricting the mandatory minimum to child pornography convicts who sexually abused minors. The stricter interpretation views that clause as a modifier only to abusive sexual conduct. In that case, the mandatory minimum could kick in when a child pornography convict sexually abuses adults.

Writing for the majority, Sotomayor takes the strict view. Applying the rule of the last antecedent, Sotomayor explains that a limiting clause or phrase should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows. She also points to three chapters of the Federal Criminal Code. The first is titled Aggravated sexual abuse, the second Sexual abuse, and the third Sexual abuse of a minor or ward. Clearly, Sotomayor writes, Congress viewed these three categories as distinct, and only meant the minor or ward clause to limit the last one. As a result, Avondale Lockharta child pornographer who attempted to rape his adult girlfriendmust spend the next decade of his life in prison.

Kagan is having none of this last antecedent applesauce. She prefers the series-qualifier canon, which holds that a modifier at the end of a straightforward, parallel list normally applies to the entire series. That interpretive practice boasts a fancy name Kagan admits, but it reflects the completely ordinary way that people speak and listen, write and read.

Then Kagan deploys her favorite trick, breezily laying out a colloquial argument for her complex case. Imagine, Kagan writes, a friend told you that she hoped to meet an actor, director, or producer involved with the new Star Wars movie. You would know immediately that she wanted to meet an actor from the Star Wars castnot an actor in, for example, the latest Zoolander. She continues:

Suppose a real estate agent promised to find a client a house, condo, or apartment in New York. Wouldnt the potential buyer be annoyed if the agent sent him information about condos in Maryland or California? And consider a law imposing a penalty for the violation of any statute, rule, or regulation relating to insider trading. Surely a person would have cause to protest if punished under that provision for violating a traffic statute. The reason in all three cases is the same: Everyone understands that the modifying phraseinvolved with the new Star Wars movie, in New York, relating to insider tradingapplies to each term in the preceding list, not just the last.

That ordinary understanding of how English works, Kagan explains, in speech and writing alike, should decide this case. By simply reading the laws text and contemplating its ordinary meaning, the court should recognize that sexual abuse of a minor or ward is meant to apply to each category of crime.

Sotomayor disputes Kagans folksy pragmatism. No one, she insists, would mistake the statutes odd repetition and inelegant phrasing for a reflection of the accumulated wisdom of everyday speech patterns:

It would be as if a friend asked you to get her tart lemons, sour lemons, or sour fruit from Mexico. If you brought back lemons from California, but your friend insisted that she was using customary speech and obviously asked for Mexican fruit only, you would be forgiven for disagreeing on both counts.

But Kagan cooks up a nice retort to the majoritys own made-up sentence:

If a friend asked you to get her tart lemons, sour lemons, or sour fruit from Mexico, you might well think her list of terms perplexing: You might puzzle over the difference between tart and sour lemons, and wonder why she had specifically mentioned lemons when she apparently would be happy with sour fruit of any kind. But of one thing, you would have no doubt: Your friend wants some produce from Mexico; it would not do to get her, say, sour lemons from Vietnam. However weird the way she listed fruitsor the way [the statute in question] lists offensesthe modifying clause still refers to them all.

Then Kagan instructs readers to pick up a journal, or a book, or for that matter a Supreme Court opinion and look for sentences having the same structure of the statutory provision at issue here. Youll quickly discover that the series-qualifier principle works. Just in case youre too busy to carry out this homework assignment, the justice does the work for you, listing five recent Supreme Court opinions that follow the series-qualifier principle.

Kagan also sneaks in a bit of legislative history to prove her point, which Scalia would never have countenanced. But her closing argument essentially paraphrases Scalias comment during oral arguments that the rule of lenitywhich dictates that an ambiguous criminal law should be resolved in favor of the defendantshould apply here. At the very least, Kagan writes, the rule of lenity should tip the scales in Lockharts favor, because the majority does not unambiguously demonstrate that the critical clause does not apply to all three crimes. But in fact, she concludes, Lockharts case is stronger:

Consider the following sentence, summarizing various points made above: The series-qualifier principle, the legislative history, and the rule of lenity discussed in this opinion all point in the same direction. Now answer the following question: Has only the rule of lenity been discussed in this opinion, or have the series-qualifier principle and the legislative history been discussed as well? Even had you not read the preceding 16-plus pages, you would know the right answerbecause of the ordinary way all of us use language. That, in the end, is why Lockhart should win.

Lockhart is a minor case about an obscure law. But Kagan uses small cases to lay out her judicial philosophy with wit and pizzazzjust look at her Dr. Seussciting fish dissent from last term. Its a shame her good friend Nino didnt live to see this opinion come down, though its rather sweet to think of him reading the early drafts with a nod of approval."
"57","Elizabeth Warren_ This reports a stunning indictment of the Department of Education.txt",288,623,21,"Active duty military members missed out on a key student loan benefit and the government failed to ensure they received it, say Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and two of her democratic colleagues.

The accusations come after a report released Tuesday by the Department of Educations Office of the Inspector General found that the Department used a flawed study design to determine whether student loan servicers were denying active duty service members the 6% interest rate cap on their student loans to which theyre entitled, perhaps inaccurately portraying the extent to which service members were denied the benefit.

The Department published a news release on May 26, 2015 based on this analysis, which claimed that service members were incorrectly denied the interest rate cap in less than 1% of cases. That release is unsupported and inaccurate, the OIG report found.

Todays report is a stunning indictment of the Department of Educations oversight of student loan servicers, exposing the extraordinary lengths to which the Department will go to protect these companies when they break the law, Warren said in a statement regarding the report.

Warren and Senators Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wrote to the inspector general in August to ask that she investigate the Departments review, saying it left us with more questions than answers. The report released Tuesday is a response to that request.

The Senators were skeptical of the review, they wrote in the August letter, because it didnt jive with findings from the Justice Department that just one student loan servicer, Navient, improperly denied the interest rate cap to nearly 78,000 service members. The Justice Department reached a $60 million settlement with Navient in 2014 over claims the company overcharged borrowers. At the time, then-Secretary Arne Duncan vowed to conduct a review of the nations four largest student loan servicers over the way they treat service members that could have implications about whether they could continue to service federal student loans. Thats the analysis that the Inspector General announced Tuesday was flawed.

Banker finds homes for Puerto Rico's stray dogs (2:05) Every few months, Citigroup banker David Brownstein and his team fly dozens of stray dogs in Puerto Rico to rescue operations in the Hamptons and the Jersey Shore.

The reasons for the flawed analysis essentially boil down to statistical errors, but the sham study as Blumenthal called it in a statement, raises questions about how well the Department is overseeing student loan servicers both in their dealings with service members and other borrowers.

Servicers are typically the face of a student loan for borrowers in repayment. Theyre the companies borrowers turn to when they want to access repayment programs or other benefits theyre entitled to with a federal student loan. But consumer advocates say the companies dont do enough to make borrowers aware of their options and as a result more borrowers than necessary struggle with their loans.

These findings raise serious questions about whether the Department and its Office of Federal Student Aid can be trusted to protect the millions of borrowers under its care, Warren said of the OIG report in her statement.

The Department has taken steps in recent years to help ensure that service members get the interest rate cap when theyre entitled to it. Now servicers are required to match their portfolio of borrowers with a Department of Defense database and automatically provide active duty service members with the interest rate cap.

Still, the Department takes very seriously the issues raised by the OIG report, Dorie Nolt, the Departments press secretary wrote in a statement. We expect to review the OIGs findings more carefully and take any appropriate steps to ensure that the Departments reviews of financial institutions meet the highest standards."

"59","EPA bans a pesticide often used on almonds and other California crops.txt",246,435,24,"Federal regulators said Tuesday they will ban a pesticide widely used on California crops such as almonds and alfalfa, saying it imperils aquatic insects that are the food source of fish.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday filed an intent to cancel registration of all products containing flubendiamide, most commonly used in Belt, manufactured by Bayer CropScience, based in Germany. The chemical is also used in products made by Nichino America.

See the most-read stories this hour >>

Canceling the registration would prohibit any further sales of products that include the ingredient.

The EPA said it found that the compound breaks down into a more toxic chemical that is harmful to insects that are an important element of the aquatic food chain.

California growers have used the chemical since 2008, and they applied 42,495 pounds of it to 521,140 acres in 2013, the last year for which complete data were available, according to the state Department of Pesticide Regulation.

More than a third of that was applied to almonds: 14,693 pounds on 125,557 acres, according to the department. Growers applied 6,002 pounds of it to 91,828 acres of alfalfa, and 3,684 pounds to 78,348 acres of processing tomatoes, which are used in paste and other products.

Other top crops that used more than 1,000 pounds of the chemical included corn, walnuts, cotton, sunflowers, wine grapes, pistachios and table grapes, according to the department.

A spokesman for Bayer was not immediately available for comment Tuesday.

Last month, Bayer refused a request by the EPA to voluntarily cancel use of the product, saying it strongly disagreed with methods the agency used to study the chemicals effects.

Denying a products registration and ignoring its safe use history based on unrealistic theoretical calculations calls into question the EPAs commitment to innovation and sustainable agriculture, Dana Sargent, Bayer vice president of regulatory affairs, said at the time.

The California Almond Board said it hoped Bayer and EPA could find ""a fair and science-based process to assess the chemical's safety.

Environmental groups praised the EPAs decision even as they warned that many chemicals receive conditional approvals before their safety can be fully vetted.

Id love to see the EPA build on this decision and seriously consider halting the conditional registration of pesticides, said Nathan Donley, a scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group.

"61","EU migrant crisis_ Calais 'Jungle' clearance work resumes.txt",408,783,50,"Media caption ""Samir"" says the demolition makes him feel ""not human""

Demolition teams have been dismantling more makeshift shelters in the migrant camp known as the ""Jungle"" in the French port of Calais.

They met little resistance in contrast to Monday, when there were clashes.

French police have warned that they will use force if the migrants refuse to move to nearby shipping containers.

But many migrants fear they will be required to claim asylum in France and give up hope of travelling to Britain.

French authorities believe about 1,000 migrants will be affected by the eviction plan while aid agencies say the number of people living there is much higher.

On Tuesday, riot police entered the camp with shields, batons, helmets and tear gas - prepared for trouble, but meeting little resistance, reports the BBC's Anna Holligan in Calais.

They were followed by bulldozers, which cleared away wooden pallets, blankets and debris.

Those living in the camp, mainly from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa, hope to cross the Channel to the UK, often using people traffickers to try to enter illegally.

About 100 shacks were dismantled on Monday. At least 12 shelters were set ablaze.

'Borders of pain' - media analysis by BBC Monitoring

In France, the camp clearance is generally not on the front pages, although regional daily La Voix du Nord is headlined ""Jungle set ablaze"".

National paper Le Figaro has a feature on migrants who are so fed up with the life in the Jungle that they want to go home. ""We're treated like animals. We're slowly dying,"" Afghan Nasrat says.

In Germany, the papers focus on Monday's storming of the Greek-Macedonian border and the continuing debate over Chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal migration policy.

""Europe's pain threshold,"" says a headline in Die Welt, using a word that also translates as ""borders of pain"".

""Athens loses control over refugees,"" says Sueddeutsche Zeitung, arguing in a in a commentary that the ""suffering"" on display in Greece vindicates Mrs Merkel's approach, while an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung believes Ms Merkel is failing to win over the other EU states and Turkey.

The story is also well covered in Russia, whose government - according to some - sees the refugee crisis as a way to sow division in the EU.

On Monday, under cover of darkness, migrants tried to access lorries on the motorway heading towards the port.

French media say about 150 people, some wielding sticks and iron bars, walked on to the road to block vehicles.

Riot police fired tear gas, forcing them back, our correspondent reports.

In pictures: Anger as 'Jungle' cleared

At least four people, including activists from the UK-based No Borders group, were arrested during Monday's unrest, police say.

Earlier, Good Chance, a theatre group which works in the camp, said police were stopping volunteers from entering the camp.

French officials say public areas such as places of worship or schools will not be affected. They describe the clearance as a ""humanitarian operation"".

Conditions in the southern sector are squalid and the camp's sprawling presence has become a controversial issue in both France and the UK.

Total camp population is disputed - Calais officials say it houses 3,700, while Help Refugees puts it at 5,497

Figures for the southern half (facing immediate eviction threat) are estimated at either 800-1,000 or 3,455

There are 205 women and 651 children (423 unaccompanied), says Help Refugees

Local government's long-term aim is to have no more than 2,000 migrants living in Calais, says its chief, Fabienne Buccio

Migrants resist relocation to containers

Officials say migrants can either move into converted containers in the northern sector of the camp, where there is room for 1,500 people; move to similar accommodation centres elsewhere in France; or claim asylum in France.

But many residents are reluctant to leave the Calais area.

Afghan migrant Hayat Sirat told AP news agency: ""Going to Britain... is what people [here] want. So destroying part of the Jungle is not the solution.""

"62","EU referendum_ How British expats in Spain feel about the vote.txt",401,863,48,"Image caption Brian Last (second from right) watches his beloved Gunners

Brian Last seems to have two great passions in life: Arsenal Football Club and the European Union.

At an expat bar in Benalmadena, on the Costa del Sol, Brian was watching his club play a Champions League match on television. And the animation he displayed whenever his team got the ball was matched by his passion for the EU.

""I've got really good Spanish friends. Obviously, I feel English and British first, then I feel European,"" he says.

What worries Brian is that Britain might now vote to leave the European Union.

""If I decided to up sticks, I could go to Portugal or France. But if Britain decides to leave that may change.""

No-one knows how many British people are, like Brian, long-term residents in Spain; the number is thought to be anywhere between 300,000 and 700,000.

Image caption Hundreds of thousands of British citizens live in Spain

But the British government has warned that two million British expats in Europe could be adversely affected in the event of an Out vote. Their right to free healthcare and their basic right to work could both be jeopardised, a Cabinet Office report says.

Campaigners to leave the European Union have dismissed the report's findings as ""scaremongering"", part of what they see as a long-term strategy by the government which they have dubbed ""project fear"". It aims, they say, to persuade voters to stick with what they know and remain inside the EU.

'Not just the money'

But fears about leaving the EU are all too real, as far as Christine Rowlands is concerned. She's the chairwoman of the Costa del Sol branch of Conservatives Abroad, and insists that the party locally is united in wanting to remain inside the EU, unlike her political counterparts back home.

""It's not just about the money,"" she insists. ""Our friends are Danish, German, Spanish. It's about a united Europe.""

Image copyright Christine Rowlands/Facebook Image caption Christine Rowlands says expats want a ""united Europe""

Asked what she makes of the Conservative debate on Europe back home in Britain, Christine giggles a little mischievously. ""It's like a children's playground,"" she says.

There is certainly a stark contrast here with the situation back home, where local Conservative Associations are perceived mainly to be of a Eurosceptic bent.

Eurosceptic voices

But in fact, there are plenty of Eurosceptic opinions to be heard on the Costa del Sol if you listen to the local English language radio station, Talk Radio Europe, and particularly its weekly phone-in show Viewpoint. It recently devoted a whole edition to the EU referendum, prompting many callers to sound off against the EU and all its works.

David Cameron was denounced for fighting to keep Britain in, while Boris Johnson was praised for his ""courage"" in joining the Out camp. ""We did not vote for federalism, we voted for a common market,"" protested one listener.

Viewpoint's presenter is Richard Tildesley, a man with his ear very much glued to the ground when it comes to political opinion among expats. And he believes that living on the European mainland has put many people off the EU, however cosmopolitan their lives.

Image caption Richard Tildesley says many expats see the EU as destroying local, individual cultures

They are not impressed by how EU funds are spent, he believes, thinking the money is wasted on unnecessary projects while neglecting problems that badly need sorting out. Tildesley also argues that expats see the EU as destroying the very aspects of Spanish life that originally drew them to the country.

""What they perceive being created at the moment is a rather bland, pan-European homogenised culture.""

Registration drive

Given the strength of opinion on this subject, it is perhaps surprising that so few expats in Spain have actually registered to vote, either in the forthcoming referendum, or indeed for any British elections.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The British embassy in Spain is encouraging British expats to register for the vote

British citizens who leave the country are entitled to vote, providing they have been away for less than 15 years. But so far, only 11,000 people from the hundreds of thousands in Spain are on course to make use of this right.

The British embassy in Spain has launched a campaign to persuade British expats to register for the vote, a campaign that is being mirrored in countries across the world. It will use Facebook and Twitter to get its message across, but the embassy will also work with local Anglican churches, charities and any other organisations where expats are found.

""Registration of expat voters is fairly low across the world,"" British ambassador Simon Manley complains. Like any good diplomat, he gives no hint of his own view on the UK's membership of the EU, but he is passionate about the need for more voter engagement.

""The referendum is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to determine the future of our country. Whatever their views, wherever they live, I think it's important people exercise that right to vote.""

Then on Tuesday, her husband, Kyle Martino, had to fire the new nanny. Now she's revealing why that went down and, in her own words, it's a ""CRAZY (and salacious)"" story.

Kyle told Eva about the second firing while she was on her way back from a one-day business trip in New York, the actress and mom wrote Monday on her blog, Happily Eva After.

"" 'Don't panic,' he told me, 'But I had to fire the Nanny this morning. Let me tell you the whole story before you freak out.' And tell me, he did  while my stomach dropped out of my body and my hairs stood up on the back of my neck.""

Oh. Em. Gee.  There is a CRAZY (and salacious) story up on the blog today. https://t.co/ZHreeWnxKo pic.twitter.com/l4j2ZaQzWj  Eva Amurri Martino (@TheHappilyEva) February 29, 2016

Nanny No. 1 had been let go after an uncomfortable confrontation that Eva  Susan Sarandon's daughter  didn't go into detail about on her blog.

""The gist is that I caught her being untruthful with me in a major way,"" she wrote. ""When I asked her some further questions and gave her the opportunity to come clean, she became defensive, insulting, and derogatory. It was absolutely shocking, and what I now realize was a viscerally defensive reaction to having been discovered in this lie.""

She characterized it as ""a major break up  of a relationship that I had been in for just under a year and a half. It was completely unexpected and deeply emotional, and it brought up many feelings for everyone in our family.""

The firing of Nanny No. 2 seems to have kicked it up a notch, however.

""The Nanny usually arrived at 9am (and stayed until 6pm). She knew that I was arriving home on Tuesday but didn't know what time,"" the mother of one wrote. "" An hour before she was supposed to arrive for the day, Kyle got a text message from her show up on his cell phone,"" Eva wrote. ""It said:

""'OMG. Girl, did I mention to you how hot and sex my Boss is. I would love to ... his brains out ha haah. Too bad he seems not to like thick Latin women with lots to hold on to LOL.'""

Kyle was freaked out enough that he took their daughter to breakfast while he figured out how to handle it, his wife wrote. Then on the way home, he saw the nanny  who'd shown up for work and let herself in with her key while they were out  peeking out from the master bedroom. Having decided that the text was no mistake, he raced out to work for the day.

""He also realized in that moment that he was going to record his entire confrontation with her,"" Eva said. ""Because he knew that clearly this chick was crazy  and who knows what she would try to make up or twist after the fact.""

A transcript of that conversation follows in the post, rendered as if it were a script. Key elements: She doesn't fall over herself with embarrassment when he calls her out on the inappropriate text. He writes her a check to pay her for the day's work, then he fires her.

Amurri's lady radar was working at full strength by this point.

""Clearly, that text was not a mistake. If it had been a mistake, she would have been humiliated, so frantic to make it right (I've been there with mistaken texts, I know). That text was sent out as a missive to test the proverbial waters with my husband and give her an opportunity later, when alone, to bring up a sexy dialogue with him,"" she wrote, praising her husband for how he handled the situation and flipping out a bit (OK, a lot) about the idea of this woman positioning herself to do the nasty with Mr. Martino.

Insult to injury: They were now without child care again, and Daddy was headed to the East Coast for 10 days.

To give themselves ample time to hire a new full-time nanny, Eva said, they all packed up, and she and her daughter tagged along for the ride.

""So here we are: in Westchester,"" she wrote. ""Together. Strangely, this bizarre Nanny experience brought us even closer (emotionally and geographically) than we would have been otherwise.""

Of course, Amurri Martino's online audience had some opinions, including one person who thought she should look after her child instead of hiring someone to do it. So, it was public smackdown time.

Great idea, Chris! Then maybe you can pay for everything in my life that I pay for with my salary? Thanks! Xo https://t.co/VXp2OPfvQv  Eva Amurri Martino (@TheHappilyEva) March 1, 2016

"64","Even some immune cells cant resist sugarand it makes them hyperactive too.txt",294,606,32,"When we think of clogged arteries, we tend to vilify hamburgers, french fries, and other high-fat indulgence foods.

But these fatty foods have a quiet accomplice: sugar. Or rather, the immune cells that over-indulge on it.

Researchers from Stanford University have found that immune cells lurking in plaque buildups in arteries tend to over-consume sugar. When they do, they produce an over-zealous inflammatory response, which likely contributes to coronary artery disease (CAD)a condition in which constricted arteries restrict or block blood-flow around the heart, leading to heart attacks, heart failure and death. The disease affects about 16 million (pdf) Americans annually. Their research was published (paywall) Monday (Feb. 29) in the Journal of Experimental Medicine.

CAD is not just a disease of french fries and hamburgers, but a disease of the immune system, Cornelia Weyand, a rheumatologist and immunologist at Stanford and lead author of the study, told Quartz. Weyand and her colleagues found evidence that as certain types of white blood cells, which help fight infections, consume sugar in the blood, they produce a hormone called interleukin-6, which is associated with inflammation. Our bodies also produce IL-6 when were experiencing high levels of stress.

Inflammation is a crucial part of our immune systems; without it, we wouldnt be able to recover from anything from superficial cuts to live-saving surgeries, Weyand said. But equally critical to summoning an immune response is our bodys ability to turn it off. For years, scientists have understood that chronic inflammation plays a role in coronary artery disease and other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, but they havent understood the specific mechanisms.

For this work, Weyand and her team examined the blood of 140 patients with CAD who had suffered at least one heart attack, and over 100 samples of blood from healthy patients. The immune cells from patients with CAD tended to consume more sugar than the immune cells from healthy patients.

They love to eat sugar. They pull in sugar, and they burn it. As they burn it, they make a few mistakes, Weyand says.

First, these cells produce extra IL-6, which causes inflammation. And in doing so, they also produce free-radicals, which are highly reactive chemicals that can cause damage to other parts of cells, like DNA or proteins needed for healthy cell function.

One of the proteins Weyand found to be damaged by these free radicals was a protein that normally helps derive energy from sugar. The alteration causes this protein to make its way into the cells nucleus, and hijack the cells normal activity to tell it to produce more inflammatory hormones. Its something of a snowball effect.

Weyand says that these changes are likely a result of many sets of genes in a persons body, and is currently working with her team to study the epigeneticsor family history of genesthat may lead to these other inflammatory side effects.

Medications that can target immune cells that produce too much IL-6 dont currently exist. Weyand and her team proposed several possible pharmaceutical routes that could be pursued. Simply altering your diet to keep fats and sugars low isnt enough keep your heart and arteries healthy, if youre at risk for CAD, Weyand said. If there is sugar in your bloodand you should always have someover-active immune cells will just keep gobbling it up.

The best thing you can do to keep your arteries clear and healthy, though, is exercise. Exercise is an important way of regulating glucose levels, Weyand says. When we exercise, our muscles pull in glucose to use for energy. Without that extra sugar in our blood streams, its unavailable for immune cells to over-indulge."

"66","Facebook executive arrested over drug-trafficking case.txt",200,375,16,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A Facebook executive was being held in police custody, officers said

A Facebook executive has been arrested in Brazil after the firm failed to co-operate with court orders in a drug-trafficking case, police have said.

According to reports, Facebook's vice-president for Latin America, Diego Dzodan, was held for questioning in Sao Paulo on Tuesday.

Court officials in the Brazilian state of Sergipe requested his arrest.

Facebook said it was an ""extreme and disproportionate measure"".

""Facebook has always been and will be available to address any questions Brazilian authorities may have,"" the company said. It added that the arrest stemmed from a case involving its messaging service WhatsApp, which operates separately from the Facebook platform.

Federal police in Sao Paulo said they carried out an arrest warrant issued by a criminal judge from the Lagarto district, in Brazil's smallest state, Sergipe. A statement released by the force said Facebook had been ordered by a court to provide evidence that would aid an investigation into ""organised crime and drug trafficking"" that was being heard in private.

The Reuters news agency reported that court officials in Sergipe also confirmed the detention of Diego Dzodan.

A source told the BBC that the Facebook office in Brazil deals only in sales and said that no-one there had access to WhatsApp user information or the authority to make decisions on behalf of the messaging app.

Privacy concerns have frequently put Facebook and other internet giants at odds with Brazilian law enforcement officers seeking evidence in criminal cases, although the confrontations rarely rise to the prominence of Apple Inc's current stand-off with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, Reuters said.

In December, a Brazilian judge suspended the Facebook-owned WhatsApp messaging service for about 12 hours after the firm failed to comply with two court orders to share information in a criminal case. WhatsApp is reported to be the most used application in Brazil, with about 93 million users.

Brazilian courts have not shied away from targeting senior tech officials. Reuters reported that, in 2012, an elections court in Mato Grosso do Sul ordered the detention of Google's most senior executive in Brazil after the company failed to take down YouTube videos attacking a local mayoral candidate."
"67","Facebook executive jailed in Brazil as court seeks WhatsApp data.txt",337,625,23,"By Brad Haynes

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian police arrested a senior Facebook Inc executive on Tuesday as a dispute escalated over a court's demand that the company provide data from its WhatsApp messaging service to help in a secretive drug-trafficking investigation.

Court officials in Sergipe state confirmed that a judge had ordered the jailing of Facebook Vice President for Latin America Diego Dzodan. Federal police in Sao Paulo state said he was being held there for questioning.

Law enforcement officials withheld further information about the nature of their request to the messaging service that Facebook Inc acquired in 2014, saying that doing so could compromise an ongoing criminal investigation.

The arrest, which Facebook called an ""extreme and disproportionate measure,"" came as social media and Internet companies face mounting pressure from governments around the world to help them eavesdrop on users and filter content.

Arrests of officials from social media companies are extremely rare, though not unprecedented, because the companies typically comply with local court orders, especially from countries where they have branch offices.

""Precisely because these large global Internet companies have staff in many countries who are vulnerable to legal action including arrest and criminal charges, they generally do comply with legally binding requests from authorities for user data or to remove or block content in those countries where they have 'boots on the ground,'"" said Internet freedom activist Rebecca MacKinnon.

Prior to its acquisition by Facebook, California-based WhatsApp had less skin in the game in disputes with governments outside the United States because, unlike Facebook, it did not have staff scattered around the globe.

""WhatsApp is a company that was started very focused on U.S. laws,"" said Internet law attorney Marcia Hoffmann. ""Now that it's owned by a company with people and resources in other countries, there is more leverage for those governments to put pressure in new and in different ways. Arresting executives is one of them.""

While details of the case remain murky, court officials said the judge in Brazil resorted to the arrest after issuing a fine of 1 million reais ($250,000) to compel Facebook to help investigators access WhatsApp messages relevant to their drug-trafficking investigation.

That is likely impossible because WhatsApp began using end-to-end encryption technology in 2014 that prevents the company from monitoring messages that travel across its network, said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union.

""They are using technology to try to take themselves out of the surveillance business,"" Soghoian said.

The arrest surfaced as Apple Inc finds itself at odds with the United States government on similar grounds.

U.S. prosecutors want the company to build a software tool to help investigators unlock the iPhone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, California, attacks. Apple has refused, saying it would set a dangerous precedent that would make its customers vulnerable to spying. Privacy concerns have previously put Facebook at odds with Brazilian law enforcement seeking evidence in criminal cases, although the confrontations rarely rise to the prominence of Apple's current standoff with the U.S. authorities. In December, a judge suspended Facebook's popular WhatsApp phone-messaging service in Brazil for about 12 hours after it failed to comply with two court orders to share information in a criminal case.

Brazil passed an Internet law two years ago aimed at streamlining thorny legal issues, but lower courts still have vast discretionary powers according to legal expert Ronaldo Lemos, a chief architect of that 2014 law.

""The court of appeals tends to be more sensitive in these cases, but the lower courts are still tough, as today's decision shows,"" said Lemos.

"70","France razes migrant camp as Greece seeks EU aid.txt",420,819,36,"Calais (France) (AFP) - Demolition workers tore down more makeshift shelters in France's grim ""Jungle"" migrant camp Tuesday, as Greece pleaded for EU aid to help shelter thousands of refugees stuck in misery at its border.

In the northern French port city of Calais, tensions were high as officials for a second day razed part of the Jungle camp, which has become a magnet for people hoping to reach Britain.

Some sat on the roofs of their shacks, covered in blankets against the driving rain and freezing wind in a bid to stop their temporary homes from being pulled apart.

Officials tried to convince inhabitants to leave voluntarily and move to better accommodation provided for them, but many refused, fearing it will take them further from their goal of reaching Britain.

There was no repeat of the violent clashes that erupted on Monday, but some remained defiant in the face of the bulldozers.

""We have already seen prison and torture, this doesn't scare us,"" a migrant told one of the teams.

View gallery Policemen stand next to migrants on the roofs of their shacks in a bid to stop their temporary homes 

Officials say the demolition will affect between 800 and 1,000 people, although charities working there say there are more than 3,450 people in the southern half of the camp, including 300 unaccompanied children.

One Sudanese migrant, Nureen, watched as the destruction moved gradually towards his makeshift home. He had been told to leave by Wednesday morning.

""Unfortunately, we cannot fight the police,"" he said. ""There is nothing for us to do. We will just be left in the cold winter.""

- Greek misery -

The late winter freeze brought similar misery to Greece's border with Macedonia, the latest flashpoint in Europe's worst migration crisis since World War II, which many fear poses a threat to the very core of the European project.

Athens said Tuesday it had requested nearly half a billion euros in emergency funds from the European Union to help shelter 100,000 refugees.

More than 7,000 people have been stuck on the border after Balkan states imposed a tight daily limit on the number of migrants allowed to enter.

Bleak scenes saw the refugees stranded in mud-soaked fields and fighting over food distributed from the back of a van.

""We have been waiting for six days,"" said Farah, a 32-year-old Syrian, as a van distributing canned food and long-life milk was quickly mobbed and emptied in minutes.

""The food is not enough, everyone is lying to us and we are desperate,"" she said.

The grim situation has sparked growing criticism of countries that have capped the number of migrants they are willing to let in, under the strain of a flood of people fleeing poverty and conflict in Africa and the Middle East -- notably Syria.

Top NATO General Philip Breedlove said the crisis was playing into the hands of Russia by destabilising Europe, accusing the Syrian regime and its ally Moscow of ""deliberately weaponising migration in an attempt to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve"".

The UN said over 131,000 migrants had crossed the Mediterranean to reach Europe so far this year, more than the total number for the first five months of 2015.

- EU chief on crisis tour -

The EU lashed out at Macedonian police for tear-gassing desperate refugees who tried to force their way across the border with Greece on Monday, saying it was ""not our idea of managing the crisis"".

Despite the criticism, countries in the firing line were standing firm.

""We cannot take in hundreds of thousands of people. We are not Germany's waiting room,"" Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann told the Heute newspaper.

""It cannot be that people are just waved through Greece, Macedonia and Croatia and that Austria does the EU's job of sharing them around.""

Macedonia said it would stepping up troop numbers on the border

In a bid to ease the deep divisions over the crisis, EU president Donald Tusk set off Tuesday on a tour taking him to Vienna and the Balkan states, as well as Turkey, the main departure point for refugees, where he will press for ""a more intensive engagement"" from the government.

Germany, which registered 1.1 million migrants in 2015, said it had reached an agreement with Tunisia to speed up the repatriation of rejected asylum-seekers from the North African country, which it considers safe.

And 308 migrants -- mostly from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria -- are being sent back to Turkey by Wednesday under a deal signed between the two countries in 2002, according to a source in the citizens' protection ministry."
"71","French, Spanish, German ... Java_ Making Coding Count As A Foreign Language.txt",261,509,40,"French, Spanish, German ... Java? Making Coding Count As A Foreign Language

i LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

Florida is poised to become the first state to allow computer coding to fulfill a foreign-language requirement in high school. In a competitive job market, the thinking goes, computer skills are as important as speaking another language.

At SAIL High School in Tallahassee, a 3-D printer whirs away. It's turning PVC pipe into a red, Lego-like piece for a robot.

This is the OctoPiRates robotics club. These students will soon compete in a national contest with their hand-built robot. It features a square, metal frame with eight rubber wheels and a scooping arm.

Many of the OctoPiRates members, like Ram Moore, are self-taught.

""I mostly learned on my own, and I took AP Computer Science,"" Moore explains. ""And from there, I taught myself some other skills.""

Another student, Alexander Olson, says he's forgotten a lot of the Spanish he took for two years in middle school, and wishes he had learned coding instead: ""This would have stuck with me a lot longer.""

Most technology runs on computer code. But it's not widely taught in Florida's public schools. Lawmakers are hoping to change that.

State Sen. Jeremy Ring, a Democrat, says he wants students to add coding languages like Python, Java or C++ into the mix of traditional languages like French and Spanish.

""Whether you're going into politics, sales, it doesn't really matter,"" Ring says. ""You need to have a technology understanding in order to compete in life, and in a professional environment.""

The idea is getting wide support. Florida students don't have to take a foreign language to graduate from a public high school  they can choose other electives. But the state's public university system does require at least two years of study in another language, and Ring's bill would allow coding to count for that.

Not everyone is happy. The Florida Foreign Language Association's Linda Markley argues that coding is not the same.

""World languages meet the needs of the business industry today,"" Markley says. She adds that her group has spoken with business leaders and, ""they're in agreement. If they need to hire someone for a job, world language skill is going to trump any other skill they feel they can train them on the spot.""

Some executives, however, like the idea of coding as a replacement language.

Like Microsoft Chairman John Thompson: ""If you had a chance to take coding and coding triggered a thought in your mind that, 'I can do this and do it well,' ... Why wouldn't you do that? I think that's a great idea.""

Florida isn't the only state building coding into the curriculum. In Texas, students can take computer science if they first take a foreign language and perform poorly. Alabama now allows computer science to count toward math graduation requirements.

Florida would be the first state to allow coding as a substitute for foreign language. The bill is expected to pass this week and Gov. Rick Scott has indicated he'll sign it."

After Salomon Rondon put West Brom ahead, Leicester hit back through Danny Drinkwater and Andy King, only for Gardner to earn the visitors a point by arcing a free-kick into the top-left corner in the 50th minute.

Tottenham Hotspur can go above Leicester on goal difference if they win at West Ham United on Wednesday, while Arsenal will be just three points behind them if they overcome Swansea City.

""We made a lot of chances, but the ball didn't want to go inside. This is football,"" Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri told Sky Sports.

""But I'm more happy now than after the match against Norwich. Tonight we played much, much, much better.

Ranieri made two changes to the team that had edged Norwich City 1-0 at the weekend, Danny Simpson and King replacing Daniel Amartey and the injured N'Golo Kante, and saw his side fall behind in the 11th minute.

Darren Fletcher's through-ball released Rondon and the Venezuelan striker shrugged Robert Huth to the ground before steering a shot beneath Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.

Drinkwater equalised on the half-hour with a shot that deflected off Jonas Olsson and looped over Ben Foster and after Jamie Vardy had headed against the bar, Leicester went ahead in first-half stoppage time.

Marc Albrighton's crossfield pass from the left was audaciously back-heeled into King's path by Riyad Mahrez and the Welsh midfielder swept home.

But five minutes into the second half Gardner levelled after Mahrez had been penalised for handball, caressing the ball over the wall and past a flat-footed Schmeichel from around 22 yards.

"76","General says terrorists in 'daily' refugee flow to Europe.txt",379,736,36,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Violent extremists, criminals and foreign fighters are part of the daily refugee flow into Europe, the top NATO commander in Europe told lawmakers, ""masking the movement"" of these dangerous elements and heightening the potential for an attack.

In testimony Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove said the Islamic State is ""spreading like a cancer"" within this mix, ""taking advantage of paths of least resistance, threatening European nations"" and the United States.

Breedlove later told reporters that he has asked for more U.S. forces to be permanently based in Europe, which is facing threats from a more aggressive Russia as well as the Islamic State group.

He provided no details in his first public comments on the request, but a senior U.S. official said Breedlove has asked for more Army troops that could be ready to respond quickly to any crisis or military need. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity, would not say how many troops Breedlove had requested.

The Pentagon has steadily decreased the number of U.S. forces in Europe over the last several years, choosing to shift focus to the Asia Pacific while fighting continues in the Middle East. But the growing threats from Russia and the Islamic State have raised questions about those decisions.

In response to a question about whether the Islamic State will continue to infiltrate refugee flows, Breedlove said, ""I think that they are doing that today.""

Those fears fueled legislation that would crack down on Syrian and Iraqi refugees seeking to enter the United States. A House-passed bill would require new FBI background checks and individual sign-offs from three high-ranking federal officials before any refugee from Syria or Iraq could enter the country.

The legislation cleared the House in November in the aftermath of the Paris attacks. It received 289 votes, a veto-proof margin that included 47 Democrats  despite President Barack Obama's opposition. But in January, Senate Democrats blocked the legislation, saying it reflected Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's call to bar Muslims from coming to the United States.

Breedlove said Russia's actions in Syria have ""wildly exacerbated the problem."" Despite its public pronouncements, Russia has done little to counter the Islamic State but instead has bolstered Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Russia and Assad, Breedlove said, are using migration as a weapon to overwhelm European support structures and break European resolve. He cited the use of barrel bombs, which are unguided weapons and have no military value, against civilians in Syria. The only purpose of these indiscriminate attacks is to terrorize Syrian citizens and ""get them on the road"" and make them problems for other countries, Breedlove said.

In the wake of Syria's civil war and the rise of the Islamic State, the people fleeing Syria and Iraq were what Breedlove described as ""legitimate"" refugees. They were escaping civil war, terrorism and unresponsive governments. But that's changed in recent months, he said.

""This criminality, the terrorists, and the returning foreign fighters are clearly a daily part of the refugee flow in Europe,"" Breedlove said. He added that reports suggest that about 6,000 foreign fighters have left to join the fight in Syria and Iraq, and that about 1,500 of them have returned to Europe.

The International Organization for Migration said Tuesday that almost 130,000 migrants  more than 2,000 each day  have reached Europe by sea since the beginning of this year and 418 have died trying, most drowning in the cold, rough waters. The number of arrivals in the first two months of 2016 is more than 11 times as many as the same period last year.

The organization estimated that last year's total of more than 1 million seaborne migrant arrivals likely will be surpassed in 2016, possibly before the end of the summer.

Breedlove said forcing the flow of migrants into Europe fits into Russia's goal of using nonmilitary means to create divisions in the NATO alliance and the European Union.

""What we have seen is that this is putting great pressure on the nations of Europe,"" he said.

In addition to the dangers posed by terrorists in the refugee mix, Breedlove warned that opposition from local nationalists in Europe to the large influx of refugees could lead to violence.

Maybe it is Switzerland's neutrality that persuades the motor industry's big guns to turn out in such force for the Geneva Motor Show.

This year, the show is being dominated by the launch of a clutch of supercars, sports cars and luxury motors from the likes of Bugatti, Ferrari, Lamborghini and Aston Martin.

While car shows in Detroit and Frankfurt vie for importance, they tend to be dominated by the host countries' companies.

It's Geneva's level playing field that the good and the great who run the industry find attractive - well, that and possibly the chance to squeeze in some skiing.

So the 86th Geneva Motor Show starts this week with the industry's mood much improved.

After years of painful restructuring and the near-death of several companies, motor manufacturing has climbed out of recession.

European car sales last year were 14.2 million, 9.2% higher than in 2014, though still below levels before the economic crisis.

And 2016 has got off to a good start, with sales up 6.3% in January year-on-year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.

There has been much debate, especially during the bad times, about whether spending millions of euros and dollars on motor show car launches is worth it.

In the era of social media, YouTube and the iPad, some people argue that motor shows are less important for getting the message across.

And with today's cars as much about technical wizardry as performance and design, marketing departments are increasingly diverting some of their budgets to tech events like Las Vegas's Consumer Electronics Show.

Exotica

Yet, there are few signs at this Geneva show that carmakers are rowing back. The list of product launches is long, as is the showcasing of new technologies, concepts and curiosities.

Analyst Tim Urquhart, from IHS, thinks the show will be less about themes, and more about ""the European industry taking care of business, coming up with compelling product that will bring buyers into showrooms and maintain the current positive sales trend.""

Geneva has a reputation for debuting the exotic, and this year does not disappoint. Take a bow, the Bugatti Chiron.

For petrol heads, the launch of Bugatti's successor to its Veyron supercar will provide the show's wow factor.

Jeremy Clarkson described the Veyron thus: ""It has rendered everything I've ever said about any other car obsolete. It's rewritten the rule book, moved the goalposts and in the process, given Mother Nature a bloody nose."" The Chiron is Bugatti's attempt to improve on it.

Details were being kept under wraps until the official unveiling today. But to beat the Veyron, the Chiron needs to do 100km/h in under 2.7 seconds and have a top speed of more than 424kmh (264mph). It's all road legal - and yours for about $2.5m (1.8m; 2.3m).

Happy birthday Mr Lamborghini

Back in the real world (if that's the right phrase), Ferrari is debuting two cars, the California T Handling Speciale and the GTC4 Lusso four-seater. The latter is pitched at the younger family man (and woman). The kids should enjoy doing the 100km/h in 3.4 seconds.

Meanwhile, Ferrari's near-neighbour Lamborghini celebrates the birth of its founder 100 years ago with the unveiling of the Centenario. Lamborghini has been promising an all-new car, not a tweak to an existing model, so aficionados have been getting excited.

However, if you've got a spare 2m (1.5m), look elsewhere. Only 40 are being made - and they were all sold two months ago.

Another hotly-anticipated debut is Aston Martin's DB11, a replacement for the DB9 (the DB10 moniker was skipped because it was used in James Bond's last film, Spectre).

'Profit generator'

Last year, Aston's boss Andy Palmer hinted that the company might address complaints that each new generation of cars was starting to look alike.

Image copyright Maserati Image caption Sportscar maker Maserati is making a bold move into a new market with the Levante

That's sparked a lot of speculation about the DB11's design. A few spy shots of a camouflaged DB11s have aired on social media, but nothing official has so far been released.

Look out, too, for Maserati's entry into the crowded market for sports utility vehicles. If Geneva underlines any trend, it's the seemingly unstoppable growth in SUVs.

Audi, Seat, Skoda are among a string of manufacturers displaying new SUV products. Maserati's Levante is pitched at the top of the market, with the Porsche Cayenne in its sights.

It's a big diversion for the Italian sportscar firm, but it follows other luxury carmakers, including Jaguar and Bentley, into the SUV market.

""Maserati's Levante is an important model for the brand,"" says Mr Urquhart. ""It is needed as a volume and profit generator, and to bolster the brand's credentials as a serious competitor to Porsche.""

There are reports that Maserati is working on a plug-in hybrid engine, another example of how alternative technologies are moving up the industry's value chain.

In fact, ""green tech"" will be everywhere at Geneva.

Image copyright Rimac Image caption Rimac's computer controlled system allows each wheel to independently accelerate or decelerate depending on handling and driving conditions

Five years after a small Croatian company, Rimac, revealed its all-electric Concept One supercar, the firm is unveiling a production version. The car gets 1,073bhp from four electric motors, and a top speed of 221mph - making it the fastest electric car on the planet, Rimac claims.

Hydrogen

At the other end of the design scale, the UK's boutique manufacturer Morgan is showing its EV3 electric three-wheeler. The technology was developed with the help of a 6m UK government grant. The car has a range of about 120 miles per charge, and with a price tag of 30,000.

Geneva will also see a big push of hydrogen technology. Honda is showing its Clarity Fuel Cell vehicle, Toyota its Mirai.

The fuel cell uses oxygen and hydrogen, producing electricity, heat and water vapour as by-products - and it clearly has big backers, but many people are sceptical that this will win out over rival technologies.

Just last week, Dieter Zetsche, boss of Daimler, which is working on battery electric and fuel cell cars, said that the former technology was likely to win out because charging technology and infrastructure was fast improving.

Image copyright Renault Image caption Away from the supercar glamour, the new Scenic could mark one of the show's most significant launches

Of course, there will be plenty of more mainstream stuff at the show, including the launch of the fourth-generation Renault Scenic.

MPVs were the great sales success story of the 1990s, but the popularity waned with the rise of SUV and so-called crossover models.

Can the Scenic make us fall in love again with MPVs?

Amid all the supercar glamour and technological hype, it could well be that it is this latest variant of Renault's segment-leading family car that becomes the lasting sales success to come out of the show."

A Georgia O'Keeffe work, considered the most expensive painting by a woman, will be the centrepiece of a Tate exhibition celebrating the US artist.

O'Keeffe's Jimson Weed, White Flower No. 1 has been loaned to Tate Modern by a US gallery.

The painting broke records when it sold in 2014 at Sotheby's in New York for $44.4m (28.8m).

The white flower painting is said by the Tate to show ""all the expected characteristics"" of O'Keeffe's work.

O'Keeffe, who died in 1986 at the age of 98, has become one of the most famous female artists through her trademark nature painting, particularly those of flowers.

The Jimson weed bloom is native to New Mexico, where O'Keeffe had a home.

She grew fond of the plant and allowed it to grow unchecked in her garden.

The Wisconsin native went on to make it the subject of multiple works, each showing it in a different way.

Tate Modern said the work was a ""particularly striking example"" because of its ""frontal perspective... and symmetry"".

The work is normally housed in the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas.

Image copyright Georgia O'Keeffe Museum Image caption The exhibition will feature more than a hundred of O'Keeffe's works

""We are delighted to be showing this iconic work by O'Keeffe for the first time in the UK for over 20 years,"" said Achim Borchardt-Hume, the Tate's director of exhibitions.

""What better moment to celebrate her influential career than 100 years after her debut.""

The 1932 painting was bought by Walmart heiress Alice Walton in 2014, who put it on display at the Crystal Bridges Museum, which she founded.

The previous record sale price for a work by a female artist was held by Joan Mitchell's Untitled, which sold for 7.5m in New York, also in 2014.

More than 100 examples of O'Keeffe's work, spanning a period from 1915 until the 1960s, will be displayed in 13 rooms at Tate Modern from July to October.

It will be the first major exhibition to open following the unveiling of its 260m revamp in June."
"79","German top court hears plea to ban far-right NPD.txt",186,314,18,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The NPD holds rallies on May Day - as do many other groups

Germany's highest court is considering whether to ban the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD).

The federal upper house (Bundesrat) took the case to the constitutional court in the western city of Karlsruhe.

The petition argues that the NPD is racist and anti-Semitic, and poses a threat to Germany's democratic order.

A previous attempt to ban the NPD failed in 2003 because the judges dismissed evidence provided by state agents who had infiltrated the party.

The NPD is not represented at national level, but has members in the Mecklenburg-West Pomerania state assembly in former East Germany. It also has one seat in the European Parliament, held by former party chief Udo Voigt.

Image copyright EPA Image caption NPD leader Frank Franz (L) and the party's MEP Udo Voigt are attending the session

NPD members have joined regular ""anti-Islamisation"" marches by the right-wing Pegida organisation, based in Dresden.

The NPD's anti-immigrant stance is part of widespread German anxiety about the influx of non-EU migrants, many of them Muslim Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans fleeing war and human rights abuses.

Germany severely restricts the power to ban a political party - a legacy of de-Nazification after World War Two.

Only the Bundesrat, Bundestag (lower house) or government can launch a banning procedure.

And only the constitutional court can impose a ban, if two-thirds of the judges back it.

Critics of the new case against the NPD fear that a ban could turn far-right extremists into martyrs. The party has about 5,200 members.

There are two post-war precedents for such bans in Germany. The West German authorities banned the Socialist Reich Party in 1952 and the Communist Party of Germany in 1957.

A banning order forces a party to completely disband and its assets can be seized, the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports."
"80","Google self-driving cars lack a humans intuition for what other drivers will do..txt",477,1018,60,"Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters

On Feb. 14, a Google self-driving car attempted to pass a municipal bus in Mountain View, California. The bus did not behave as the autonomous car predicted, and the self-driving car crashed into it while attempting to move back into its lane. The Google car was traveling at the stately speed of 2 mph, and there were no injuries. Google released a statement accepting fault and announcing that it was tweaking its software to avoid this type of collision in the future.

There is good reason to believe, though, that tweaks to the software might not be enough. What led the Google car astray was the inability to correctly guess out what the bus driver was thinking and then react to it. Google said in its statement:

Our test driver, who had been watching the bus in the mirror, also expected the bus to slow or stop. And we can imagine the bus driver assumed we were going to stay put. Unfortunately, all these assumptions led us to the same spot in the lane at the same time. This type of misunderstanding happens between human drivers on the road every day.

Yes, people sometimes misunderstand one anothers intentions on the road. Still, people have an intuitive fluency with this kind of social negotiation. Self-driving cars lack that fluency, and achieving it will be incredibly difficult.

For the past five years, my collaborators and I in the Vision Sciences Lab at Harvard University have been exploring the differences in capabilities between people and todays best AIs. My studies have focused on simple tasks, like detecting a face in a still image, where AIs have become reasonably skilled. But I have become increasingly unsettled by the implications of our research for very challenging AI tasks. I am especially concerned by the implications for the extremely challenging task of driving a car. Self-driving cars have enormous promise. The improvements to traffic, safety, and the mobility of the elderly could be dramatic. But no matter how capable the AI, humans just behave differently.

In February the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration ruled that the AI software controlling a self-driving car can count as a driver, smoothing the road for nationwide testing of self-driving cars. They did this despite the fact that, as security researcher Mudge pointed out on Twitter, the NHTSA lacks a methodology for determining whether the software works correctly. Still, the federal government is moving quickly to support self-driving cars. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx has proposed spending $4 billion to help bring them to market, while private corporations have made massive, ongoing investments. Projects from companies like Google and Tesla Motors have been the most visible, but traditional car companies like Toyota (which is pouring $1 billion into a new AI institute) and GM (which has committed $500 million to a joint venture developing autonomous urban cars with Lyft) are spending freely to develop this technology as well. These billions of dollars may be pushing us toward technology that creates as many problems as it solves.

The biggest difference in capability between self-driving cars and humans is likely to be theory of mind. Researchers like professor Felix Warneken at Harvard have shown that even very young children have exquisitely tuned senses for the intentions and goals of other people. Warneken and others have argued this is the core of uniquely human intelligence.

Researchers are working to build robots that can mimic our social intelligence. Companies like Emotient and Affectiva currently offer software with some ability to read emotions on faces. But so far no software remotely approaches the ability of humans to constantly and effortlessly guess what other people want to do. The human driving down that narrow street may say to herself none of these oncoming cars are will let me go unless Im a little bit pushy and then act on that instinct, but behaving that way will be one of the greatest challenges of making human-like AI.

The ability to judge intention and respond accordingly is also central to driving. From determining whether a pedestrian is going to jaywalk to slowing down and avoiding a driver who seems drunk or tired, we do it constantly while behind the wheel. Self-driving cars cant do this now. They likely wont be able to do it for years. But this isnt just about routine-but-confusing interactions like that between the Google self-driving car and the Mountain View bus.

Even the best AIs are easy to fool. State-of-the-art object recognition systems can be tricked into thinking a picture of an orange is really an ostrich. Self-driving cars will be no different. They will make errorswhich is not so bad on the face of it, as long as they make fewer than humans. But the kinds of errors they make will be errors a human would never make. They will mistake a garbage bag for a running pedestrian. They will mistake a cloud for a truck.

All of this means that self-driving cars will be incredibly easy to troll. Sticking a foot out in the road or waving a piece of cloth around might be enough to trigger an emergency stop. Tapping the brakes of your car could trigger a chain reaction of evasive maneuvers. Perhaps a few bored 12-year-olds could shut down L.A. freeways with the equivalent of smiley faces painted on balloons.

To be clear, I invented these examples. However, security researchers have already shown that laser range-finding systems can be trivially fooled into thinking a collision is imminent. As self-driving cars increase in complexity (and they are among the most complex computer systems ever made) and as their sensors get more complex, the number of ways they can fail will increase. These failures will almost all be completely different from the ways that human drivers can fail.

Roads are shared resources. Car commuters, pedestrians, bicycles, taxis, delivery vehicles and emergency vehicles all occupy the same space. Self-driving cars introduce a whole new category of road user. And its a new category of road user that entirely lacks an understanding that all those road users share."
"81","Grey hair gene discovered by scientists.txt",171,308,14,"Image copyright SPL

Scientists have pinpointed a gene responsible for grey hair - a discovery that could lead to new ways of delaying or preventing this natural sign of ageing, they say in Nature Communications.

Hair dyes can cover up greying but gene manipulation may, in future, banish it altogether.

The international team collected DNA samples from ""a diverse melting pot"" of more than 6,000 volunteers of European, Native American and African ancestry.

The gene IRF4 regulates a natural hair, skin and eye pigment called melanin.

It sits on chromosome six and while it is unlikely to be the only gene controlling greying, it provides a new target for researchers.

Lead author Dr Kaustubh Adhikari, from University College London, said: ""We already know several genes involved in balding and hair colour but this is the first time a gene for greying has been identified in humans, as well as other genes influencing hair shape and density.

Image copyright Thinkstock

""It was only possible because we analysed a diverse melting pot of people, which hasn't been done before on this scale.""

Hair gets its colour from pigments produced by cells called melanocytes that sit in the hair follicle - the root of the hair.

As we age, the melanocytes stop producing the pigments and the hair loses its natural colour and goes grey.

Experts believe there are many genetic as well as some environmental factors involved in this ageing pathway - IRF4 is now an example that we now know about.

As well as the greying gene, the researchers also found a gene linked to monobrows and others linked to beard and eyebrow thickness.

Dr Adhikari said: ""The genes we have identified are unlikely to work in isolation to cause greying or straight hair, or thick eyebrows, but have a role to play along with many other factors yet to be identified."""

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are poised to leap ahead of their competition in the Democratic and Republican primaries on the road toward their respective parties presidential nominations.

A dozen states are holding primaries or caucuses on Tuesday, the busiest day on the primary calendar and one with the largest number of convention delegates up for grabs.

On the Republican side, a total of 595 delegates are at stake, about half of the 1,237 needed to claim the GOP nomination. For Democrats, 859 delegates will be allocated, more than a third of the 2,383 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.

For Republicans, the big prize is Texas, which has the most delegates and the highest stakes for home-state presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz. On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton is expected to have the toughest time in Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Vermont, the home state of rival Sen. Bernie Sanders.

The elections will be held in a variety of regions, from the South to New England, which will provide a glimpse of the national appeal of the front-runners and any hints at their weaknesses. Dubbed Super Tuesday, the contests are one of the last opportunities for the rivals of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump to slow their march toward the convention stages in Ohio and Pennsylvania this summer.

Heres a rundown on what to watch:

Texas

Mr. Cruz called his state the crown jewel of Super Tuesday last week, and he wasnt kidding. A treasure trove of 155 Republican delegates are at stake. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll found Mr. Cruz leading Mr. Trump by 13 points, but the senator has tried to temper expectations by stopping short of predicting a win.

Mr. Trump, who has spent minimal money on television advertising in the last few months, is spending $1.1 million in six Super Tuesday states, with the biggest share going to the Lone Star state. He also added a rally to his schedule in Fort Worth on Friday.

Under Texass complex rules, Mr. Cruz likely will have to share delegates with Mr. Trump, even if he gets more votes. So Mr. Cruz is looking for a commanding margin of victory that will signal he is well-armed to take on Mr. Trump.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, riding high from a scrappy debate on Thursday night, kept up his anti-Trump fusillade at a rally in Dallas on Friday, but his attacks might be too little too late.

For Mrs. Clinton, Texas is the linchpin of a series of contests in March that her aides believe will put her in a commanding position for the nomination.

With 222 pledged delegates at stake, Texas is the biggest prize on Super Tuesday, and it is hospitable terrain for Mrs. Clinton. Exit polls in the 2008 race showed that Hispanics and African-Americans made up more than half the Democratic electorate, a mix favorable to Mrs. Clinton.

Democrat Hillary Clinton won a landslide victory in South Carolina thanks to strong support among African Americans, but Bernie Sanders showed no signs of dropping out. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains where the Democratic race stands heading into Super Tuesday. Photo: AP

It is no coincidence that immediately after the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 20, Mrs. Clinton got on a plane and flew straight to Houston for a late-night rally. Aides wanted to put her before a large, appreciative crowd in Texas as a show of strength.

Polling shows the former secretary of state leads Mr. Sanders by about 30 points in Texas, a level of dominance that has made the state difficult for him to contest. Advertising is expensive in Texas and Sanders aides have been reluctant to air television ads in Texas with no guarantee of a payoff in terms of votes. Even a million dollars in Texas doesnt go a long way, said senior Sanders adviser Tad Devine.

Virginia

The commonwealth is a big prize, offering the victor 49 Republican delegates, as well as bragging rights, because of its status as a coveted swing state in the general election.

Mr. Trump is leading by 14.5 points, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average, and he appeared in the southwestern part of the state on Monday. But Mr. Rubio is making a play for the state, and he condemned Mr. Trump at four rallies Sunday for failing to reject the support of white supremacist David Duke in TV interviews; Mr. Trump later on Twitter disavowed the support. Only Mr. Trump, Mr. Rubio and a pro-Rubio super PAC are spending money on TV advertising in the state.

Virginia also looks to be Clinton country. The states governor is Democrat Terry McAuliffe, one of the Clinton familys biggest political allies.

Clinton aides know Virginia well: Campaign Manager Robby Mook ran Mr. McAuliffes winning gubernatorial campaign in 2013. Looking to capture the states 95 delegates, the Clinton campaign has been deploying its best known surrogate, former President Bill Clinton.

Polls taken last month show Mrs. Clinton with a lead in Virginia that averages nearly 20 points.

Georgia

The Peach State will award 76 GOP delegates, the second-biggest bounty on Tuesday after Texas. Mr. Trump is sitting on a 7-point lead, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll, with Messrs. Rubio and Cruz competing for second.

The last place a candidate visits before Election Day is usually a telltale sign of his or her priorities, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to appear at a rally in Valdosta Monday night. Georgia was also Mr. Trumps first destination after his Feb. 20 victory in the South Carolina primary.

I will campaign as long as it takes, Mr. Rubio said in suburban Atlanta on Saturday, promising to not quit until he knocks out Mr. Trump.

If the South is Mrs. Clintons fire wall, Georgia is the reinforced-steel fortification.

Exit polls in 2008 showed African-Americans were 51% of the Democratic electorate. Black voters proved loyal to Mrs. Clinton in the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 20 and the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary.

One of the icons of the civil-rights movement, Georgia Rep. John Lewis, has endorsed Mrs. Clinton and vouched for her credentials as a friend of the black community.

Mr. Sanders has snapped up some endorsements of his own, including that of former NAACP President Ben Jealous. Mr. Sanders also took part in a rally at the historically black Morehouse College in Atlanta last month, accompanied by rapper Killer Mike.

Still, Mrs. Clinton remains the overwhelming favorite to snag the bulk of Georgias 102 pledged delegates: The Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Mrs. Clinton with a nearly 40 point lead in Georgia.

Tennessee

GOP Gov. Bill Haslam announced he was endorsing Mr. Rubio on Thursday, and hours later, Mr. Rubios campaign began airing a TV ad featuring the popular governor. Mr. Rubio has also won the endorsement of Sen. Lamar Alexander.

Yet, Mr. Trump is ahead by 18 points, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll, with Messrs. Cruz and Rubio running neck and neck for second place.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who hasnt spent as much time in the South as his GOP rivals, recently devoted two days to Tennessee, appearing in Nashville, Memphis and Knoxville on Friday and Saturday. That is because 58 delegates are at stake, making Tennessee the third biggest prize of Super Tuesday.

Mr. Sanders hasnt bothered to air TV ads in Tennessee, a clue that it is not a state he believes to be winnable. Exit polls from 2008 showed the states Democratic primary voters were nearly 30% African-American.

Every state is different, but Mrs. Clinton is already demonstrating overwhelming support among black voters. Exit polls show she won 86% of black voters in South Carolina on Saturday. Should she perform anywhere near this well in Tennessee, Mrs. Clinton will walk away with a large share of the states 67 delegates.

Massachusetts

The Bay State is a contest Mr. Sanders should be able to win. His campaign has aired TV ads in Massachusetts, demonstrating they believe the state is in play.

In the busy week between the Nevada and South Carolina contests, Mr. Sanders made time to squeeze in appearances in Massachusetts, hoping to win the states 91 delegates and partially offset Mrs. Clintons expected victories in the South.

One prize that eludes himand Mrs. Clinton, for that matteris the endorsement of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. A darling of liberal Democrats, Ms. Warren has so far stayed neutral.

The Real Clear Politics average shows Mr. Sanders trailing by about three points. Given the makeup of the states Democratic voters, one might expect him to be doing better. Mr. Sanders tends to do best with white, liberal voters. Exit polls in 2008 showed that Massachusetts Democrats were about 85% white, and nearly 60% considered themselves liberal.

However, the Clintons have deep ties to the state, dating back to Mr. Clintons two runs for president, and many of the partys elected leaders are with the front-runner.

Massachusetts is also a state where Mr. Kasich has invested, with hopes of having a good showing somewhere outside the South. On the night of the Feb. 20 South Carolina GOP primary, he held a rally in Worcester.

Still, Mr. Trumps appeal to white, working-class voters could propel him in this typically blue state, and he has a 28-point lead, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average.

Vermont

Mr. Sanders is expected to enjoy a big win in his home state. The senator is a popular figure across the board, having won re-election in 2012 with 71% of the vote. Still, it is the smallest of the 11 Super Tuesday contests. Only 16 pledged delegates are up for grabsless than 1% of the total needed to clinch the nomination.

This liberal state, along with Massachusetts, is where Mr. Kasich is expected to perform the best on Tuesday, but only 16 Republican delegates are on the line.

He campaigned here on Feb. 20, the day of the South Carolina primary, and held a town hall in Castleton on Monday. A Vermont Public Radio poll last month found Mr. Trump with a comfortable lead, drawing support from 32%. Mr. Rubio received 17%, while Mr. Kasich got 10%.

Arkansas

GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson threw his support behind Mr. Rubio last week. Still, he said in a recent National Public Radio interview: Trump is a juggernaut that is difficult to unravel at this point.

Mr. Trump rallied in Bentonville on Saturday with his newest high-profile supporter, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, while Mr. Cruz appeared in Little Rock on Saturday with conservative talk show host Glenn Beck.

The state will award 40 Republican delegates. There have been no recent public polls of the Republican race in the state.

Mrs. Clinton enjoys a home-field advantage in the state where she taught law, practiced law and served as the nations first lady.

The main airport in Little Rock is named after her husband and her. In a testament to the relationships she forged in Arkansas in the 1970s and 80s, a band of friends and allies called the Arkansas Travelers often shows up on the campaign trail in other states to help Mrs. Clinton make the sale.

Polls show her with a 29-point lead over Mr. Sanders in Arkansas.

Alabama

The Yellowhammer State will award 50 delegates on Tuesday, and Mr. Trump looks well-positioned to scoop up a plurality. A Monmouth University poll released Monday showed him with 42% support of likely Republican voters, compared to just 19% for Mr. Rubio, 16% for Mr. Cruz, 11% for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and 5% for Mr. Kasich.

Mr. Trump rallied in Madison on Sunday and picked up a key endorsement from Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions.

On the Democratic side, Alabama is another piece of Mrs. Clintons Southern fire wall. The states Democratic electorate was 51% African-American in 2008, giving Mrs. Clinton a formidable advantage. The Real Clear Politics average shows Mrs. Clinton with a 38-point lead, and there are 53 delegates to win.

In December, she spoke at an historic black church in Montgomery for a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the bus boycott. Speakers included icons of the civil rights movement, including Bernice King, daughter of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Organizers didnt bother to invite Mr. Sanders.

Oklahoma

Mr. Trump is leading the GOP pack with 35% of the vote, according to a Monmouth University Poll released on Monday. Messrs. Cruz and Rubio are essentially tied for second place, with 23% and 22%, respectively.

Mr. Rubio won a key endorsement Monday from former Sen. Tom Coburn, and his last two rallies that evening were in Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Forty-three Republican delegates are up for grabs.

Oklahoma looks like a potential bright spot for Mr. Sanders. The state is one of just a handful where he is running TV ads. A victory here would be a statement of sorts that Mr. Sanderss appeal isnt limited to overwhelmingly white states concentrated in the Northeast.

Mr. Sanders appeared at a rally in Tulsa last week and he showed up in Oklahoma City on Sunday, addressing about 6,000 supporters.

A poll released Monday by Monmouth University showed Mr. Sanders leading Mrs. Clinton 48% to 43% in Oklahoma, where 38 delegates are at stake.

Minnesota

The North Star state may shine bright for the Super Tuesday underdogs.

Mr. Rubio is holding an Election Day rally in Andover before Tuesday nights caucus, which will award 38 delegates. Former Sen. Norm Coleman shifted his support to Mr. Rubio after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush quit the race. Mr. Rubio also has the backing of Tim Pawlenty, the former governor. Polling has been scarce.

Democrats will also vote in caucuses, a format that tends to attract the sort of committed activists who have gravitated to the Sanders campaign.

Mr. Sanders has chosen to air TV ads in Minnesota, and he has made repeated trips to the state, including one on Saturday as the results from South Carolina were coming in.

However, Mrs. Clinton is working the state as well, and she has beaten Mr. Sanders in both of the prior caucus states: Iowa and Nevada.

Colorado

Only the Democrats are awarding delegates on Tuesday. If crowds are any indication, Mr. Sanders should get a good share of the 66 delegates at stake.

About 18,000 came to hear him speak at a raucous rally in Denver last month. This looks to me like a group of people who are prepared to make a political revolution! Mr. Sanders told them.

Mrs. Clinton has swept up key endorsements, including that of Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and Sen. Michael Bennet. While Mrs. Clinton lost Colorado to then-Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic nomination fight, polling in the state has shown her leading Mr. Sanders.

Alaska

Only the Republicans are awarding delegates in Alaska, and the results from there wont be known until Wednesday. No recent polling is available for the state, which has 28 delegates to allot to the candidates.

"85","Honeywell scraps bid for United Technologies.txt",138,208,13,"Image copyright Getty Images

Aircraft parts maker Honeywell has dropped its $90bn (65.4bn) bid to buy rival United Technologies.

On Tuesday, Honeywell said it was abandoning its efforts because of United Technologies ""unwillingness to engage in negotiations"".

United Technologies rejected the offer last week, saying regulators were unlikely to approve the deal and the price was too low.

The deal would have created one of the aerospace industry's largest companies.

""Continuing to try to negotiate with an unwilling partner is inconsistent with our disciplined acquisition process,"" said Honeywell's chief executive officer, Dave Cote.

Last week, the head of United Technologies, Greg Hayes, said accepting the deal would be ""irresponsible"".

""It would also have a material negative impact on [United Technologies'] operations, customer relationships and talent retention,"" Mr Hayes said.

United Technologies is an American manufacturer, among the businesses it owns are aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney and elevator manufacture Otis.

"86","How 3D printing is shaking up high end dining.txt",400,923,54,"Media caption ""Creativity is shaped by what technology can do,"" says Paco Perez

Paco Perez is experimenting. The chef has won several Michelin stars for his restaurants. At one of them, La Enoteca at the Hotel Arts in Barcelona, he is busy creating a new dish.

He places a plate inside a strange-looking machine that looks a bit like a large microwave oven. He touches the controls, and a few minutes later, removes the plate, which is now decorated with a delicate, flower-like design.

Next he adds more ingredients: caviar, sea-urchins, hollandaise sauce, egg, and a ""foam"" of carrot.

He calls his creation ""Sea Coral"". ""It's as if we were on the sea floor,"" he explains. ""We see a coral with sea urchins on it - then when we eat, we discover all the profundity of the sea and its iodine flavours"".

The centrepiece of the dish, the ""coral,"" is made of a seafood puree in an intricate design that would have been extremely difficult to produce by hand. But it has been piped on to the plate by a new kind of 3D printer.

Mr Perez is delighted with the results and the capabilities of the machine.

""It's very interesting what today's technology is contributing to gastronomy"" he says. ""Creativity is shaped by what technology can do"".

Image caption 3D printing enables chefs to produce exactly the same design numerous times

Image caption The specialised machines can print anything from mashed potato to chocolate

The machine he is using is called Foodini, and is made by Natural Machines, a new company based only a few miles away from La Enoteca.

Barcelona is certainly a fitting place for a business trying to bring fine dining and technology together. It's located in Catalonia, a part of Spain renowned for culinary excellence. Celebrated chefs from the region, such as Ferran Adria (who Paco Perez trained and worked with), are famous for pushing the boundaries of gastronomy ever further.

Elaborate designs

Unlike some other food-capable 3D printers, the Foodini device has been designed from the start to be a specialised food-printing machine.

It can print with a very wide range of foods, from mashed potato to chocolate. Ingredients are placed in stainless steel capsules, which are reusable.

With suitable ingredients the machine is capable of printing structures several centimetres high, making possible some quite elaborate 3D designs.

It is also a so-called ""internet of things"" appliance - which means that it can be connected to the internet, and recipes and designs can be uploaded from anywhere.

Image caption Lynette Kucsma says 3D printing enables chefs to create dishes which they couldn't do by hand

Natural Machines co-founder Lynette Kucsma says they have had a lot of interest from top chefs for two main reasons.

One is customisation, enabling the creation of dishes that are just not possible to make by hand.

""The other reason is automation"", she says. ""Imagine you need to print breadsticks in the shape of tree branches for a hundred people sitting that evening. Rather than food piping it or doing that by hand, you can automate it with a 3D food printer"".

Growing market

Other chefs apart from Mr Perez are experimenting with this new technique. Mateo Blanch from La Boscana in Lleida in Spain has been working with a 3D printer made by a Dutch firm, By Flow. He told the International Business Times last year that ""it has changed the way I work with food. I am capable of a level of precision that would never have been possible before"".

And in the USA, 3D printer maker 3D Systems has been collaborating with the Culinary Institute of America on some ambitious projects.

Suppliers of 3D food printers are optimistic that the devices will soon become common in top professional kitchens.

But for Ms Kucsma the world of haute cuisine is only the start.

She foresees a growing consumer market for 3D printers: ""as people see it coming into restaurants and  start becoming familiar with eating 3D printed food and knowing that it's made with fresh, real ingredients, that's when the mind change starts to happen"" she says.

Image caption ""Creativity is shaped by what technology can do,"" says Mr Perez

However Ms Kucsma says that there's an additional feature that could transform the appeal of these products: the ability to cook.

She says that the existing Foodini machine ""can heat the individual food capsules to do things like keeping chocolate at a good melting point"" - but for future models they are working to add the capacity to cook. Market research suggests that this could really help the products to become mainstream.

Stifling creativity?

Ms Kucsma says the professional market is likely to be less interested in printers that can cook as well as print food, since they have many other means of cooking at their disposal. The main appeal of the machines will be their ability to customise and create dishes never before possible.

But despite all the creative possibilities that makers of these devices say they have to offer, isn't there a danger that they will instead stifle creativity? If a machine combined with computer software is doing all the work, where is there room for the magic, human touch of the gifted chef?

Mr Perez dismisses such concerns: ""In its day, traditional food was the avant garde. The people who cooked it would use a blender, or a microwave, an oven, a heat lampYou see, tradition is innovation - and always has been. In moving forwards, technology will always be present."""

Curious about how to get a more seamless look for your armor made from EVA foam? Selby Props  we just featured his work on a Little Shop of Horrors puppet  put together a tutorial video on how to create seamless edges in your foam armor builds. His technique gives armor a cleaner, smoother look. He especially uses the process on larger builds. Rather than slicing separate pieces of foam out from a template and piecing them back together with glue, he cut channels on the back of the armor and folded the foam into shape. The end of the video features a comparison of the finished armor using both techniques so you can see the different effects.

"90","Igor Pasternak, the Blimp-Maker.txt",127,171,8,"For the past forty years Igor Pasternak has pursued a lighter-than-air vision: to build gigantic airships that haul cargo to otherwise inaccessible parts of the planet. In high school, in Ukraine, Pasternak formed an airship club; at Lviv National University, where he studied civil engineering, he established an airship-design bureau. Eventually he settled in southern California and started Aeros, which builds blimps for surveillance and other purposes. His prototype cargo airship, the two-hundred-and-sixty-foot-long Dragon Dream, was destroyed in 2013 when its hangar collapsed on it. Unfazed, Pasternak now aims to produce a fleet of Aeroscraft cargo airships, the largest of which will be more than nine hundred feet long and able to carry five hundred tons.

Jeanne Marie Laskas profiled Pasternak in the February 29th issue of the magazine. Pasternak also spoke recently with the director and producer Gabe Polsky. Polskys documentary, Red Army, about the rise and fall of Soviet hockey, played at the 2014 Cannes, Telluride, Toronto, and New York Film Festivals, and was released in theatres in 2015."
"91","Im an Undecided Voter Who Is Stuck in a Tree.txt",316,694,47,"Im an undecided voter. Ive been paying close attention to the Presidential campaign, and, so far, Im disappointed. Theres one issue that no candidate on either side is talking about. Its the issue thats most important to me, because it affects me on a deeply personal level. You see, Im stuck in a tree, and I want to know which candidate is going to get me down from here.

Ive heard the candidates talk about veterans, senior citizens, and the unemployed. But what about people who climbed up a tree because they were trying to get their balloon back, but, once they got to the top of the tree, realized that they didnt know how to get down? Who speaks for us? Being stuck in a tree is an issue that affects many Americans. Maybe not millionsbut at least a couple of dozen. Enough to tip an election, especially in a heavily forested swing state like New Hampshire.

Yet people stuck in trees are routinely ignored by politicians and the media. If you look on the candidates Web sites, which I was doing on my phone just before I dropped it (I was going to call for help as soon as I finished my research), theres not one word about the issues faced by people stuck in trees. Ive been up here for weeks, and not a single candidate has deigned to come out to these woods to visit me. Except for John Kasich, and thats not going to do me much good.

Im sure all the candidates would pay lip service to the idea of getting me out of this tree. Theyd say that they understand what Im going through, and theyd recite some lame, over-rehearsed anecdote about how they once accidentally locked themselves in a congressional cloakroom. But empty rhetoric isnt enough. I want a detailed plan. Would a candidate act unilaterally to get me out of this tree, or would they assemble a coalition of our closest allies? Would they use a rope or a ladder? How soon can they get me down? Its very cold up here, and when the wind blows the tree shakes a lot. Would they at least build a tree house around me and supply me with snacks? These are the questions that are on voters minds.

Im not a wealthy man. If the C.E.O. of Citibank were stuck in a tree, I bet the candidates (except Bernie) would be falling all over themselves to use taxpayer money to buy a luxury helicopter to airlift him out. But I am not a C.E.O. Im just a regular guy whos tired of having to eat pinecones.

Im registered as an independent, and Im happy to vote for any candidate, Democrat or Republican, who will save me. I like Marco Rubios youthful energy. He seems strong and spry enough to climb up to this branch Im clinging to. But what then? Theres a good chance that wed both wind up trapped in this tree, and the last thing we need is for more Americans to get caught in this quagmire. Bernie Sanders would be good at shouting for help. And if Hillary Clinton rescued me, it would send a powerful message to my two young daughters that they can achieve anything. Also, it would be nice for them to hear that their father didnt die up in a tree.

I dont believe that Ted Cruz would help me get out of this tree, even if it were easy for him to do so. (As for Ben Carson and Donald Trump, Id prefer someone with more experience working in government to get me down from here.)

The point is, Washington doesnt work if its not working for folks who are stuck in trees, and

AHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Hey! Im back on the ground! I fell out of the tree, and I didnt get hurt at all! You know, I think Ive learned something from this experience: People who are stuck in trees should be like me and get themselves down instead of waiting around for handoutshand-downs? Whatever. My vote will now go to the candidate who gets me a new balloon."

i toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images

Chances are, you've never heard of flubendiamide. It's not among the most toxic insecticides, and it's not among the widely used chemicals, either. In recent years, it has been used on about a quarter of the nation's tobacco and 14 percent of almonds, peppers and watermelons.

But flubendiamide is now at the center of a public dispute between the Environmental Protection Agency and the company that sells it, Bayer CropScience. That dispute is arousing fear in the pesticide industry  and hope among activists who are pushing for the EPA to regulate pesticides more tightly.

The EPA wants to cancel its approval of this pesticide. The agency says that there is now evidence that this chemical will accumulate in streams and lakes, where it will kill off small, freshwater creatures like snails and crabs that play a crucial role in the entire web of aquatic life.

But the real reason that this decision is attracting so much attention is that flubendiamide is just one of thousands of pesticides that the EPA approved on a ""conditional"" basis, pending the results of further studies that were required to assure that agency of the chemicals' safety. The pesticide industry fears  and anti-pesticide groups hope  that many other chemicals, also approved conditionally, soon could face increased EPA scrutiny as well.

""We're really encouraged that the EPA went for cancellation"" of flubendiamide's approval, rather than a lengthy process known as a ""special review,"" says Kristin Schafer, policy director at the Pesticide Action Network, or PAN.

Conditional approvals allow the EPA to OK a pesticide when the benefits of using it outweigh any apparent risks  such as in a public health emergency. But pesticide critics such as PAN and the Natural Resources Defense Council have criticized the EPA's heavy reliance on this process. They say it has turned into an easy way for companies to start selling their products without really proving that their products meet legal safety requirements  and that the EPA seldom follows up.

In the case of flubendiamide, the EPA was concerned, from the beginning, about the possibility that the chemical would accumulate in water. The agency has now concluded that this is likely.

The company that sells the pesticide, Bayer CropScience, is refusing, so far, to stop selling the chemical. The company says that the EPA is relying on computer models that overstate the environmental risks, rather than observations of flubendiamide in the real world.

The company is insisting on a hearing before an administrative law judge at the EPA in order to make its case."
"93","In Detroit, people are urged to get a second mortgage when buying a house.txt",326,717,28,"The housing market in Detroit is so troubled that a new program has been created to help home buyers take out two mortgages when buying a home  one for the purchase price and one for renovations.

Detroit has the highest vacancy rate in the country at more than 12%, with more than 93,000 homes in the metro area unoccupied in August 2015, according to Trulia.com, a San Franciscobased real-estate research company. The city of Detroit, which filed for bankruptcy in 2013, has been desperate to revitalize neighborhoods and increase property-tax revenue.

The latest problem, said Laurie Goodman, director of the Housing Finance Policy Center, a research group based in Washington, D.C., is that, as a result of there still being so few comparable properties on which to base an appraisal in Detroit, the value of a rehabbed home wont be properly reflected.

In most neighborhoods nationwide its easy for appraisers to determine value based on nearby homes. But in Detroit there are some neighborhoods where the home being rebuilt is the only one left standing.

As a result, a home that was purchased for $30,000 and rehabbed for an additional $30,000 may be appraised at just $50,000, Goodman said, making it unlikely buyers will be willing to invest. Its also unlikely that lenders would write a mortgage for a property so impaired.

This disparity creates a vicious cycle: rehabilitating is not profitable, so there is little incentive to invest in a home, Goodman said in a blog post published by the Urban Institute, the Housing Finance Policy Centers parent organization.

But the new program, the Detroit Home Mortgage, or DHM, will offer borrowers a second mortgage that, combined with the first loan, can exceed the appraised value of the house and help homeowners pay for the necessary rehabilitation to make the home safe to occupy.

Under the program, the borrower takes out a first mortgage with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 96.5% of the appraised value of the home from one of five participating lenders.

The borrower simultaneously obtains a second mortgage (up to $75,000 with an interest rate of 5% and for no more than 20 years) to cover the difference between the purchase price of the home plus rehabilitation costs and the value of the first mortgage. Normally, this would be considered a big risk to the bank, but because the backers of the program  the Ford and Kresge Foundations and the Minnesota-based Community Reinvestment Fund  are guaranteeing the second mortgage, the banks can afford to take the risk of default.

The second mortgage can also be forgiven under certain circumstances, according to the DHM website. In certain severe cases, if a home buyer experiences an extreme hardship and sells the home, the second mortgage may be forgiven, according to the terms of the program.

Buyers need a credit score at least in the range of 600 to 640 and have to put down 3.5% on the property and take out two mortgages. The home must be located in the city of Detroit. Five local banks will do the lending. About $40 million has been set aside for the second-mortgage program, according to the DHM website.

Self-driving Google car hits a bus (1:00) One Alphabet Inc. unit Googles self-driving cars hit a bus while in autonomous mode  possibly the first accident involving one of the cars that was the fault of the computer.

The strategy isnt unique. For example, some lenders routinely factor in necessary improvements in considering a loan on an otherwise derelict property, such as a rustic cabin with no plumbing or heat, to improve the loan-to-value ratio and make the loan work.

The situation in Detroit is so dire that in 2014 the city even tried selling houses for $1,000 in hopes of luring buyers to fix up derelict properties. A check of Zillow.com shows that currently nearly 400 homes are for sale in Detroit for less than $5,000. And almost 40 homes are listed for less than $1,000. The median home value, according to Zillow, was just $37,000, down 8.9% in the past year.

The program, said Goodman, could be a major turning point for Detroit. By allowing for mortgages with loan-to-value ratios over 100%, it could break the vicious appraisal spiral, which has systematically undervalued rehabbed homes, she said."
"94","In pictures_ Learning the Knowledge.txt",401,921,54,"Tucked away inside the nondescript walls of a multi-storey car park between Caledonian Road and King's Cross, the family-run Taxi Trade Promotions, better known as Knowledge Point, continues to provide prospective black-cab drivers in London with an education in what is named - quite simply, yet somewhat ominously - the Knowledge.

Photographer Alexander McBride Wilson stepped inside to meet the current batch of recruits.

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

A proud and noble tradition dating back to 1865, the Knowledge is a rigorous and in-depth study of the streets, routes and notable locations of London, which a hopeful driver must master before they are deemed eligible to enter the ranks of what is one of the oldest land-transportation services in the world.

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

Malcolm Linskey opened up Knowledge Point in 1985. Having completed the Knowledge himself at the age of 23, and after spending a few months as a driver, he became more and more interested in the trade as a whole. Using his previous experience in print, he started a trade magazine, which, in times of cash-flow problems, he funded by selling Knowledge material.

""It's a job where you're going to be guaranteed a wage. You're your own boss and you work the hours you want to work. There's no better job that can do that.

""Say you've got bills to pay and they need to be paid by the end of the week, you can go out there and earn that wage to pay them bills. Maybe it'll take you 15 hours one day to go and earn that but it's out there to be earned.""

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

In order to earn a licence as a black-cab driver, students of the Knowledge must know by heart the location of every street, theatre, pub, sport venue, embassy, hospital, tourist attraction, intersection, even traffic light, as well as a staggering 320 different routes or ""runs"" that lie within a six-mile radius of the centre of London.

According to cabbie lore that is not, as many might think, at Charing Cross, but rather more specifically situated underneath the posterior of Charles I's horse just in front of Trafalgar Square.

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

A true test of mental resolve, the average time it takes to learn the Knowledge is three and a half years. Unsurprisingly, about 75% of those who embark on the course give up.

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

Pat Linskey, Malcolm's wife, has been working for the company since 1987. ""I came to help out on a Friday afternoon to type up the 320 different runs on an old typewriter. We actually drove them on weekends - I've done them all.""

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

Ten days before Knowledge Point was planning on packing up for good, London Taxi Company, a business that deals in selling and maintaining new and used taxis, offered it space in a small unit within a taxi garage so that it could continue trading. Up until that point Malcolm and Pat had been planning on retiring.

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

Originally a plumber by trade, Tahir was looking for a fresh start. Now, having been studying for three years, he says doing the the Knowledge is the hardest thing he's ever done.

""When I have an exam I work seven days a week. It's very hard - it's a constant thing. Sometimes you dream about it.""

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

To learn London's roads, students spend countless hours driving through the city on mopeds - going through each of the 320 runs.

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

Having completed the Knowledge at the school back in October 2008, Peter Allen takes some time out of his cab each week to pass the trade on to new blood.

""For me [being a cab driver] is a way of life. I could earn more money in a cab than I could teaching this, but I really want to get the emphasis out about the real pride we have in our job, and to get these people out feeling like proud cab drivers and proud to get this badge that they've worked so hard for.""

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

Training is done in pairs and often the partners will go through the entirety of their course working together and supporting one another.

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

The school becomes a second home for future drivers, with the days spent studying often lasting long into the evening. ""I don't really have a social life - even at weekends. I used to go out every weekend but now I can't really go out because I know I have to plan stuff for the following week. It has to be full-time,"" said Jack Cawley.

""There's a geezer who didn't let it affect his social life and he's been doing it 18 years. If it doesn't take over your life then I don't see you doing it properly. I don't see any of my friends no more - only my Knowledge friends.

Image copyright Alexander McBride Wilson

""My old man says people you do your Knowledge with will be your friends for life because you spend every day with them,"" he adds.

""It's just like school in a way but the difference is that this is for you. There's a massive end result - the pride and the financial side. It's a massive tradition in this country and to be part of that is something to be proud of as well.""

Hundreds of young men in India's Bihar state have been made to strip down to their underwear while appearing for an army recruitment test in an attempt to prevent cheating.

Photographs showed candidates sitting cross-legged in a field in Muzaffarpur town wearing only their underpants.

The army said it was done to ""save time on checking so many students"".

A candidate told The Indian Express newspaper that he felt ""it was not dignified"".

Officials said 1,159 candidates participated in Sunday's hour-long written examination to join the Indian army.

""As we entered Chakkar Maidan, the venue, we were asked to remove all clothes except underwear. We had no option but to comply with the instructions even though it felt odd. The gap between candidates was about eight feet in all directions,"" The Indian Express quoted a candidate as saying.

The paper quoted a senior army official as saying candidates being asked to strip was an ""administrative lapse"".

Bihar and many other parts of northern India are notorious for cheating during examinations - last year, the state government was embarrassed after parents and friends were photographed climbing school walls to pass on answers to school students.

In January, the state announced tough measures such as fines and jail terms to stop cheating in exams."

"98","Irans Voters Sent a Message to the Hard-Liners.txt",511,1032,59,"Iranians revel in political humor. Over the weekend, as election results began to show that long-entrenched hard-liners were losing, a new joke circulated in Tehran: Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had called Secretary of State John Kerry with an offer: John, we have just succeeded in defeating our hard-liners. Let us know if you want advice on how to beat Mr. Trump.

Irans twin pollsfor the Majlis, or parliament, and for the Assembly of Experts, which chooses the countrys Supreme Leaderwerent quite that straightforward. Before the vote, most reformists were disqualified by the governments mercurial vetting process. Voters countered by rejecting big-name hard-liners who had blocked reforms at home and tried to stymy the nuclear deal with the outside world. The result is a wave of new faces in Iranian politics; only about a third of the winners are incumbents in parliament. The number of women almost doubled, and younger candidates also won more seats. The largest bloc will be made up of centrists, moderate conservatives, and independents, with a few real reformists (who often won the highest vote counts). Within the revolutionary confines of the Islamic Republic, it was a big deal.

Reformist papers ran banner headlines and huge pictures hailing the victors. Epic of hope: An unforgettable day, declared Etemad; Aftab-e Yazd declared, The Breeze of Victory. Hard-line papers took a different tack. Many reformists boycotted the last election, so Amin emphasized the sixty-per-cent turnoutEveryone Cameas proof that the majority of Iranians had endorsed the political system. Kayhan, the most extreme hard-line paper, charged that President Hassan Rouhanis backers had created an illusion of victory. Its editor, Hossein Shariatmadari, wrote, The structure of Irans ruling system is such that no political faction can change the main polities rooted in core principles.

In Tehran, all of the citys thirty seats went to the so-called List of Hope, nominated by the Universal Coalition of Reformists. Even the leading hard-liner, a former speaker of parliament connected by politics and family to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, lost his seat. Conservatives and a smattering of hard-liners fared better in the provinces, and will still have a large parliamentary presence. But they lost the guaranteed dominance that they have enjoyed since 2004.

The vote was a major boost for President Rouhani, who has initiated the most serious rengagement with the outside world since the 1979 revolution. He has also pledged to reform Irans ailing economy and increase individual freedoms. Kudos to the history-making nation of Iran, he tweeted Monday, on his English-language account. Lets open a new chapter based on domestic talents & global opportunities. Now Rouhani has to deliver. He faces re  lection next year.

The election certainly offers no guarantee that Rouhani will make progress navigating Irans toxic political environment, but at least the election ousted members of parliament who had repeatedly blocked his initiatives. Some had publicly called Iranian diplomats traitors, or vowed to bury them under cement for negotiating with the United States. The atmosphericsand the signals from the youth-dominated electoratereflect an overwhelming interest in shifting course on both domestic and foreign policy.

The election also marked something of a comeback for former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who orchestrated constitutional changes and economic reforms after the death of the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1989. Rafsanjani, nicknamed the Shark for his political skills and his smooth, beardless face, had been marginalized in a power struggle with the current Supreme Leader. In 2000, after serving as President and as parliaments speaker for almost a decade, he was humiliated in a run for parliament when he lost, disputed the vote, and then withdrew, largely to save political face. In 2005, he lost in another campaign for the Presidency, against the hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. And in 2011 he was forced out as chair of the Assembly of Experts by hard-liners. Two of his childrenMehdi and Faezeh, who is also a former member of parliamentwere sentenced to jail terms on trumped-up charges. Two other children, Fatemeh and Mohsen, were disqualified from running for parliament in this election.

For this election, Rafsanjani organized a coalition slate for the Assembly of Expertsand won the largest number of votes. His decisive victory could position him to lead the body again. Its widely believed that he covets the job of Supreme Leadera lifetime appointmenteven though hes older than the current leader. In an Instagram post this weekend, he wrote, Competition is over. The era of unity & cooperation is here.

In contrast, the hard-line chairman of the Assembly of Experts, Mohammad Yazdi, lost his seatnot just against one rival but in a field that allocated sixteen slots for Tehran representatives. Mohammad Mesbah-Yazdi, who had been the spiritual mentor to former President Ahmadinejad, was also voted out of office.

Even a prominent hard-liner who managed to hold on to his position faced embarrassment. Ahmad Jannati has been a member of the Guardian Council since 1980 and its chairman since 1988. The Councils twelve clerics vet all candidates and legislation, wielding enormous power behind the scenes. (It was the Council that disqualified the majority of reformist candidates for this election.) Jannati has simultaneously served on the Assembly of Experts. Yet voters came within a hair of voting him out of the Assembly. He came in sixteenth out of the sixteen seats allocated to Tehrana stunning rebuke.

One of the most interesting politicians to emerge from the election is Mohammad Reza Aref, who received the most votes of any parliamentary candidate for Tehran. Aref is the leader of the List of Hope, and a former Vice-President and Presidential candidate. He stepped aside, in a field of eight, to help Rouhani, a dark horse, win in 2013. Hard-liners still control the judiciary, as well as the security forces, military, and various intelligence agencies. They are unlikely to cede powers easily. But Rouhani and Aref are now key playersand alliesin two of the three branches of government.

Iranian politics are ever evolving, and, for the outside world, ever confounding. In this election, the sharp edges that have defined internal tensions over the past decade have been dulled. Iranians voters have signalled that they want relief, not more political infighting at home or confrontation with the outside world."

An Iraqi army general and nine other soldiers have been killed in a suicide bomb attack by Islamic State militants in western Iraq, security sources say.

Four militants wearing army uniforms blew themselves up after gaining entry to a base near Haditha late on Monday.

One of the explosions killed Brig-Gen Ali Abboud, chief-of-staff of the Jazeera and Badiya Operations Command.

Another eight soldiers were wounded in the attack, which comes after a wave of suicide bombings claimed by IS.

On Monday, at least 40 people were killed by an explosion at a funeral attended by Shia militia commanders in the eastern town of Muqdadiya, while a blast at a security checkpoint in Baghdad left eight security personnel dead.

Another 70 people died in the capital on Sunday, when two militants targeted a busy market in the predominantly Shia district of Sadr City.

Samarra offensive

Haditha and its nearby dam, about 190km (120 miles) north-west of Baghdad, are in one of the few parts of the mainly Sunni province of Anbar not controlled by IS.

Iraqi government forces and allied Sunni tribesmen based there have held off IS for more than 18 months with the help of air strikes by a US-led coalition.

On Monday night, the four militants attacked an entrance to the headquarters of the Jazeera and Badiya Operations Command and clashed with soldiers inside.

One of the bombers later blew himself up inside Gen Abboud's office, while the other three detonated their explosive belts elsewhere, Maj-Gen Ali Daboun, head of the Jazeera and Badiya Operations Command, told the AFP news agency.

Elsewhere in Iraq on Tuesday, Iraqi troops backed by Shia militiamen and the Iraqi air force launched a new offensive to retake a key agricultural area north-east of the central city of Samarra.

Commanders believe that controlling Jazerat Samarra would allow them to cut IS supply lines to the northern IS-held city of Mosul."
"100","Is Nutritious Food In Peril, Along With Pollinators_.txt",268,519,26,"Is Nutritious Food In Peril, Along With Pollinators?

i toggle caption Yuri Kadobnov/AFP/Getty Images Yuri Kadobnov/AFP/Getty Images

Here's an exercise in deductive logic, with implications for our food supply.

Fact: Insects such as bees and butterflies are helpful, and sometimes essential, for producing much of our food, including a majority of our fruits, vegetables and nuts.

Fact: Many of these pollinators, especially wild ones such as bumblebees, are in trouble. In Europe, where the phenomenon has been studied most carefully, about a third of all bee and butterfly species are declining, and 9 percent are threatened with extinction.

The seemingly logical conclusion? Food production will decline along with the pollinators.

This is the basis of a headline-generating summary of a new and massive scientific report prepared by 80 scientists around the world, and sponsored by the United Nations. Only a summary of the report has been released at this point.

According to the summary, fewer pollinators could lead to food shortages, ""impacting health and nutritional security.""

This simple, logical deduction, however, is bedeviled by many complicating factors.

First, the world's biggest crops, the ones that billions of people still depend on for most of their calories, don't rely on insects or other pollinators. These crops include corn, wheat, soybeans and rice.

That still leaves a lot of other crops, though, and many of them are growing in popularity. Berries, vegetables, fruits and nuts tend to benefit most from pollinators. Marcelo Aizen, a researcher at Universidad Nacional del Comahue in Argentina and co-author of the U.N. report, has reported that the amount of land devoted to these ""pollinator-dependent"" crops has been increasing at a much faster rate, globally, than pollinator-indifferent grains.

According to Aizen, the surging popularity of these nutritious crops could run headlong into the roadblock of vanishing pollinators. With fewer bees or butterflies available, yields could fall, making these valuable foods even more expensive.

The degree of probable damage, however, is largely a matter of speculation. According to Jaboury Ghazoul, an ecologist at ETH Zurich, a leading university in Switzerland, ""in most farming systems, production is limited by other, far more important factors""  such as pests and diseases, weather, and access to fertilizer.

Some crops, meanwhile, like almonds and greenhouse-grown tomatoes, rely on pollination by highly managed colonies of bees that are multiplied in captivity and hauled by the truckload to farms where they are needed. This can be expensive, but those pollinators  unlike wild species  are not likely to disappear.

And yet another wrinkle: The places where pollinators have declined most precipitously are the places where crops don't actually need them  like the Midwestern corn and soybean belt. In much of the rest of the world, there's scant evidence that pollinators are even in trouble, which has led Ghazoul to question whether there really is a ""pollination crisis"" for agriculture. In an email to The Salt, Ghazoul wrote that ""there is an urgent need for conservation, for many reasons, but I do not believe that a clear scientific case has been made for pollinators on the basis of their contribution to food production."""
"101","Ivy League mulls banning tackles at football practices.txt",243,402,14,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Football practices at the United States' elite Ivy League universities may be a little bit quieter next year as coaches consider banning tackling outside of actual games, a spokesman for the league said on Tuesday.

Top football coaches at elite universities including Harvard, Yale and Princeton, are mulling the move as concerns grow that head injuries can take a severe toll on players' mental acuity as they age.

""This is something that has only been discussed and is not approved in any way,"" said Scottie Rodgers, a spokesman for the eight-school conference, which also includes Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth and the University of Pennsylvania.

He noted that rule changes in the league are formally put forward by school athletics directors at annual meetings that take place in May and submitted for final approval in June.

The league's coaches agreed to the move in a vote last week, the New York Times reported earlier on Tuesday.

Research has increasingly linked the head injuries that are commonly experienced in football, hockey and other contact sports with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a condition that causes lesions on the brain and can lead to aggression and dementia later in life.

View gallery Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) football players attend practice in Cambridge, Massachus 

There are currently no tests to diagnose CTE in a living patient, but Boston University researchers have found evidence of the condition in the brains of 90 of 94 former National Football League players it has studied since 2008.

One leader of the effort to limit college players' concussion risks is Dartmouth College's head football coach, Buddy Teevens, who last season introduced a robot tackling dummy developed by engineering students at the Hanover, New Hampshire, school.

The motorized dummy, called the ""Mobile Virtual Player"" is the approximate size and weight of a college football player, and allowed Dartmouth's players to practice full-speed hits while limiting the risk of injury.

Some 5,000 former players have sued the NFL, claiming it hid the dangers of repeated head trauma, and agreed to a settlement that could cost the league $1 billion. The settlement is under appeal.

Research on CTE has already prompted the NFL to ban the most dangerous helmet-to-helmet hits and require teams to keep players who have taken hits to the head off the field if they show symptoms including dizziness or memory gaps.

"102","Jack Mas expensive, lowkey strategy to battle Amazon for online shoppers.txt",172,305,15,"To stay competitive outside China, e-commerce giant Alibaba is flying under the radar and dropping billions.

Since 2010, the company has spent roughly $12 billion on more than 55 outside investments, according to CB Insights, with $9 billion of that spent in 2015 on 20 deals. And its lining up money for more. The Wall Street Journal reported Alibaba is in talks with eight banks (paywall) to raise $4 billion, much of that earmarked for e-commerce acquisitions.

Rival Amazon in contrast spent roughly $220 million in 10 outside deals in 2015, including Annapurna Labs, 2lemetry, and ClusterK. The company has poured billions of dollars into its own operations in foreign markets particularly in India, where its battling Snapdeal and Flipkart for market share.

The people in India say it is unlikely that three players will be standing at the end of the game.

Indeed, India is where the two e-commerce giants will likely go head-to-head. In August 2015, Snapdeal confirmed it had received a generous $500 million investment, naming Alibaba as one of its benefactors. And in February 2016, news reports said Alibaba was in talks with Indias largest e-commerce company, Flipkart, about an investment.

The people in India say it is unlikely that three players will be standing at the end of the game, said Harvard Business School professor Sunil Gupta. With Alibaba getting into the play, the chance is that [Amazons chief competition] will be de facto Alibaba.

In the US, where Amazon reigns supreme online (accounting for nearly one-in-five online sales), the battle is decidedly less intense. Alibaba has invested an undisclosed amount of cash in Jet.combilled as a challenger (paywall) to Amazon in Americabut the Jets performance has yet to match its initial hype.

I dont think it has got enough legs at this point, Gupta said of the upstart company."

A Dutch former prisoner-of-war held in Nagasaki when the US dropped an atom bomb on the city has won compensation from the Japanese government.

Willy Buchel, 95, was the first ex-prisoner of war to receive such a payment, his lawyer said on Tuesday.

Mr Buchel filed a lawsuit in May last year over the mental anguish suffered in the years after the 1945 bombing, lawyer Hidekazu Zaima told AFP.

He will receive 1.1 million yen ($9,640; 6,910).

Mr Buchel was in a prison camp 1.7km (one mile) from ground zero on 9 August, when the bomb detonated over the south-western Japanese city, killing more than 70,000 people.

He returned to the Netherlands in 1950 and was not able to receive full medical coverage provided to Japanese survivors of the bomb, Mr Zaima said.

Media caption Sumiteru Taniguchi was 16 when the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki

According to Japan's Kyodo News, Mr Buchel said in the lawsuit he ""was forced to continue living while suffering from peculiar health damage caused by his exposure to radiation"".

Mr Zaima told a news conference that the unprecedented settlement was of ""grave importance"".

Japan started providing overseas atom bomb victims with medical allowances in 2003. Before that, a 1974 ruling said funds would be stopped if victims travelled out of Japan.

The Nagasaki bomb followed one dropped three days before on the city of Hiroshima, where about 140,000 people are estimated to have been killed by the blast or later by radiation sickness."

A Japanese company is hoping to raise the profile of the sewage industry by giving away collectable cards featuring manhole covers.

The cards are printed with pictures of the country's unusually elaborate drain covers, and are the brainchild of GKP, a consortium of local governments and the sewage department of Japan's Infrastructure Ministry, The Japan Times reports. They come with a full explanation of the design's meaning as well as the cover's exact geographic coordinates, should the enthusiast feel moved to pay their favourite a visit.

According to the Japan Visitor website, the covers attract a special kind of tourist - ""drainspotters"" - who visit from around the world to see their distinctive designs. The covers often feature a symbol specific to an area or town, or a local mascot. Designs are decided upon after asking the public for ideas, or through competitions, GKP spokesperson Hideto Yamada says.

To be launched at a ""manhole summit"" in Tokyo later this month, the first batch of collectors' cards, developed with the help of a toy company, will be given away free to anyone who visits sewage plants or water treatment facilities, GKP says. If that's not enough for the drainspotters, the company says it's planning a second batch of manhole cards for release in July.

He died Tuesday morning in his home in McLean, Virginia, said his son, Mark Kimsey.

In the early 1980s, Kimsey, a Vietnam veteran, was a Washington, D.C.-area restaurateur. A venture-capitalist friend of his from West Point asked him to take a look at a video game download company called Control Video. That company flailed, and was reorganized into one called Quantum Computer Services, with Kimsey at the helm.

In 1991, that company was renamed America Online, famous for its ""You've got mail"" greeting. It would grow to connect millions of early Internet users with its dial-up service.

Kimsey is credited with supporting and grooming a young Steve Case, today the man largely associated with AOL's growth and success in the early days of the Internet.

""I think one of the best things I ever did was let Steve run the company,"" Kimsey was quoted as saying in a 1995 Washington Post article. ""Today that one decision to get out of the way makes me look like a genius.""

Kimsey said in 1995 that he would step down as chairman, years before AOL's ill-fated merger with Time Warner. Case took over from him.

Mark Kimsey said that after retiring from AOL, his father focused on philanthropy. He started a charitable foundation that focuses on education.

""He viewed himself as a soldier, an adventurer, a father, always looking for some new battle to fight or mountain to climb,"" Mark Kimsey said of his father.

He is survived by three sons: Mark, Michael and Raymond."

Jordan says a raid in the city of Irbid that left seven suspected jihadist militants dead foiled attacks being plotted by so-called Islamic State.

Those killed were planning to blow up civilian and military targets in the country, according to the General Intelligence Directorate (GID).

A security officer was also killed and five were injured during the overnight raid, which triggered armed clashes.

Jordan is part of a US-led coalition battling IS fighters in Syria and Iraq.

It launched air strikes on IS positions in Syria in 2014 to ensure the ""stability and security"" of its borders, and has stepped up a crackdown on suspected IS sympathisers inside the kingdom.

Last year, Jordan executed two convicted jihadists following the killing of a Jordanian pilot who was captured by IS militants after his jet crashed in Syria.

The operation in Irbid, which is 20km (12 miles) from the Syrian border, was reportedly one of the largest targeting suspected jihadists in years.

Government spokesman Mohammad Momani told the public security department's Amen radio station that the raid started at around 19:00 (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday and lasted until 03:00 on Wednesday, according to the Jordan Times newspaper.

Mr Momani described those targeted as ""outlaws"".

Later, the official Petra news agency published a statement by the GID, which said it had thwarted a plot by an IS cell to attack ""civilian and military sites in order to destabilise national security"".

Security forces tracked the suspected militants to a residential building in Irbid, which security sources said was near a Palestinian refugee camp in the city centre.

""The terrorists refused to surrender and put up strong resistance using automatic weapons,"" the GID said, adding those killed were wearing explosive belts.

Weapons, ammunition, explosives and detonators were also found at the scene.

The GID said 13 people linked to the cell were detained in earlier raids in Irbid."

AEG, the Los Angeles company behind Coachella, generally considered the most prominent US festival, is launching the July 22-24 event on the city's Randalls Island.

The festival is going ahead despite objections from organizers of homegrown Governors Ball, which will take place on June 3-5 on Randalls Island. They fear the city can't support two major festivals so close to one another.

The reflective rapper Kendrick Lamar was the biggest winner at last month's Grammys. Indie rock sensations Alabama Shakes tied for second place at the music industry's awards.

Panorama's other major acts will include leading indie rock bands Arcade Fire and The National, anonymity-obsessed Australian singer Sia and Major Lazer, one of the biggest names in electronic dance music.

LCD Soundsystem, the influential New York electronic outfit that is reuniting for Coachella, will also play Panorama.

Emphasizing the New York location, the festival will kick off with an event including figures from the art, fashion and technology worlds and will feature food from all five city boroughs.

Summer festivals are becoming a vital revenue stream for the music industry, with the number and size of events soaring in recent years, especially in North America.

Governors Ball earlier announced its lineup will include rap superstar Kanye West, alternative rock icon Beck and The Strokes, a key force in the New York punk revival in the 2000s."

"109","Latino voters need more than candidates who just look like us.txt",326,642,34,"In the wake of the 2012 presidential election, the Republican Party made it clear that its first and only priority was winning the Latino vote in 2016. But with Super Tuesday upon us, it seems the GOPs primary strategy is to simply put candidates onstage that look like us, while not appealing to our main priorities.

Thats not enough. To win this crucial demographic, conservatives will need to tone down their harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric. The rise in activism and voter registration reflects a desire from our community to be heard in the political process, not the desire to see a Latino candidate elected president. And right now, every Republican candidate, including Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, is standing on the wrong side of the issues driving voters to the polls.

The irony is US Latinos (a term were using generally here to identity the diverse group of voters with roots in Latin America) could easily find a home in the Republican Party. As Texas senator Ted Cruz mentioned during the last Republican debate in Houston, the partys message of faith, family, and patriotism resonates with many voters. Latinos have historically remained socially conservative when it comes to a pro life stance and other so-called family values, stemming from the longstanding influence of the Catholic Church. The irony is US Latinos could easily find a home in the Republican Party. Studies also indicate that they care deeply about the economy, jobs, and education. The success of politicians including Rubio and Cruz, Nevada governor Brian Sandoval, and New Mexico governor Susanna Martinez, show that Republican messages can resonate with Hispanic voters.

And yet the Republican Party continues to underestimate the importance of immigration. Latino voters are very likely to have a family member or friend affected by the debate. In this context, immigration is much more than a political talking point. Even for those voters who dont consider immigration their most important topic, anti-immigration policies often manifest themselves as anti-Latino rhetoric, driving away their votes.

After years of soul-searching, it seems the Republican Party has done more to alienate than to unite. According to the Latino Decisions Survey, voters believe that Democrats rather than Republicans support their views on immigration reform and care more about Latinos generally. In large part, this is because Republicans sponsor the harshest and most drastic immigration laws. This is already playing out in my home state, Arizona.

The anti-immigrant movement in Arizona has galvanized the Latino community into a formidable political force. The anti-immigrant movement in Arizona has galvanized the Latino community into a new and formidable political force. In response to a decade-long wave of anti-immigrant and, more generally, anti-Latino proposals like Arizona SB 1070 (the now infamous show me your papers law), members of the community mobilized. There was a major political backlash by a wide range of traditional and non-traditional political players. The state became ground zero for the nations superheated debate over immigration policy. And Arizona Latinos registered to vote in droves to push back on these policies and the Republicans who sponsored them.

Today, those same anti-immigrant forces are still at work in the Republican Party. The hardline stances on immigration adopted by the GOPs three leading candidates sound like attacks against people who are often friends and relatives.

While its hard to see Latino voters supporting Donald Trump, given his remarks disparaging Mexico, its equally hard to see them supporting Rubio or Cruz. Rubio continues to back further away from his work to reform immigration, adopting increasingly hard-line stances. Meanwhile Cruz has called for the deportation of every undocumented migrant. Hearing Republicans of Latino descent spout anti-immigrant policies does not make the party seem more attractive or compassionate. Rather, it shows how deeply out of touch the party is when it comes to winning the Latino vote.

"110","Laverne _ Curly.txt",786,1587,79,"A stoner comedy about two woke girls, created by the best friends Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer, Broad City launched, in 2009, as a set of shaggy, self-produced Web sketches. In 2014, it evolved into a confident sitcom dbut on Comedy Central, produced by Amy Poehler. From the start, the show attracted blazing devotees. Two years ago, when Jacobson and Glazer performed at the Bell House, in Brooklyn, the crowd around me was screaming as if we were at a Beatles concert, which maybe we were. In a post-Louie world, in which all the best sitcoms deal in melancholy and rage, Broad City offers something zany, warmhearted, and sweetly liberatory, like a piata spilling out Red Hots, Plan B, and pot snickerdoodles.

In the grand TV-sitcom tradition, Jacobson and Glazer play less driven, less competent versions of their younger selves. Abbi is a klutzy romantic with a dead-end job, mopping up pubic hair at a health club called Soulstice and mooning after dudes in man buns. Ilana is a horndog narcissist who torments her co-workers at a Groupon-like Internet startup called Deals Deals Deals. One of the girls lives in Queens, the other in Brooklyn, but theyre glued together in ways that anyone who has been in one of those friendships might recognize: they text non-stop, Skype during sex (well, Ilana does), smoke up, cheerlead, and justify each others grossest mistakes. The first season was pretty much perfect, the second more hit-and-miss; but the first three episodes of the new season are solid. They also raise the stakes, slightly, when Abbi scores a longed-for promotion to trainer, while Ilana gets promotedand then almost immediately canned, after she tweets out a viral bestiality video. (A well-intentioned one! She was trying to advertise a deal on colonics.)

The show nails the texture of modern New York, from the breastfeeding crone who rules the food co-op (a fantastic cameo by Melissa Leo) to the needlessly bitchy sorority girl in line at a Williamsburg bakery. But even when its characters fail epically, as they often do, the show feels optimistic, a daydream of two goofy slobs pinballing through life, every obstacle they meet just something new to ricochet off.

While Broad City is often praised for its warm portrait of friendship and sexual frankness, the spine of the show is genius slapstick. The first new episode tosses three axes in the air in the introa split-screen montage, showing a year of intimate bathroom gagsand then keeps juggling, offering up seven increasingly elaborate sequences of physical comedy. In the first act, Abbi is pulled, chest first, into a sewer grating; a pop-up sale turns into a riot; and Ilana gets her bicycle chain locked around her waist. The second act is an elegant two-step sequence, in which Abbi, desperate to pee, sneaks into a construction sites porta-potty, which is then pulled up into the air by a craneand when she escapes, gasping in relief, Ilana, who is wearing that bicycle chain, gets hooked onto the back of a bread truck, which drives off. The whole bit is perfectly timed and edited, down to the punch line: when Abbi runs over to bawl out the truck driver, she finds him watching porn as he drives. Nice ass! he screams as she walks away. I know! she yells back, in exasperation.

Later, Ilana gets magnetized to a giant set of dangling metal testicles at an art exhibit. Its the kind of lunatic image the show specializes in, an echo of classic comedy, like the disembodied nose in Woody Allens Sleeper. And while it works as a literal payoff to Ilanas rants about being trapped by patriarchy, its also satisfying as raw comedy physics; even after Abbi rescues Ilana, she keeps trying to balance the balls, adjusting a spiky pubic haira good citizen to the end.

On a recent podcast with the critic Andy Greenwald, Glazer described the shows premise as vulnerability is strength. Out of context, that might sound gooey, but it reveals something about Broad City s compassionate take on shit and sex, its insistence that bodies out of control are hilarious and lovely, not dirty and grotesque. Jacobson and Glazers take on identity politicsand their characters well-intentioned but barely informed fourth-wave, queerish, anti-rape/pro-porn intersectional feminismis a more intricate matter, both a part of the shows philosophy and a subject of its satire. When it comes to race, the series has had a particularly complicated arc, stretching back to the Web sketches, which included a loving homage to Do the Right Thing, with Abbi and Ilana punching the air like Rosie Perez.

Visually, and in terms of their friendships, the world of Broad City is racially inclusive. For a while, this diversity was regularly used as a snotty wedge against HBOs Girls, as if Abbi and Ilana were the pure Elizabeth Warren to Lena Dunhams tainted Hillary Clinton. But, in fact, Abbi and Ilana, just like Hannah Horvath, arent generic young women: theyre college-educated white kids from the Northeast, artsy urbanites who arent rich but also arent poor, even if they cant afford much. Theyre also secular Jews in a way that network sitcoms never allowed characters to be, in the nineties, when Seinfeld, Friends, and Mad About You smooshed New Yorkers into an ethnically vanilla, network-friendly neutrality.

Like many people in this demographic, the characters on Broad City are deeply into hip-hop. This is particularly true of the fictional Ilana, who dates a black guy, Lincoln (Hannibal Buress), a supremely chill dentist. (Hey, bwah, she says when she calls him. Hey, grah, he replies.) But Ilanas not just a girl with a diverse social circle, a taste for Lil Wayne, and graphic fantasies about Rihanna backstage at the Barclays Center. Shes legitimately obsessed with the notion of herself as a bi-poly-cross-ethnic sexual adventurer; at times, she seems to believe that shes not white, accusing her boss, say, of white privilege. When she hooks up with a doppelgnger (played by the Glazer doppelgnger Alia Shawkat), Ilana explains that, in bed, she craves difference: Different colors, different shapes, different sizes. People who are hotter, uglier. More smart; not more smart. Innies, outies! I dont know, a Catholic person. Its a mixture of idealism and solipsism that reminded me of a German ex of mine, who insisted on calling himself a citizen of the verld.

In real life, a white woman like this might be a nightmare of cultural appropriation, screaming Bow down, bitches! and tweeting hot takes on Black Lives Matter which shes barely skimmed. Ilanas fascination with blackness has a warmer feeling, in part because she is such an awed true believer when it comes to her heroines: as Oprah is to Liz Lemon, Nicki Minaj is to Ilana. Still, the show has always had a tricky undercurrentthe risk of finding something intrinsically funny about white people talking like black peopleand its an issue that has intensified as the national conversation has shifted around it. (The fictional Abbi expresses this worry, in a perfect modern koan. Youre so anti-racist, sometimes, that youre actually really racist, she tells Ilana.) Last season, some viewers were put off when Ilanas ridiculously elaborate masturbation ritual included pulling on big gold-hoop earrings that read, in lacy script, Latina. Who was that joke on? And who got to make it?

This season, rather than skirt the subject, the show steers straight into it, starting with a sly gag that involves Ilana imitating foreigners, from Italians to Germans. Do Chinese! Abbi says. Ilana stares back, knowingly: Its 2016, dude. This becomes the rich theme of the second episode, when Ilana asks Abbi to impersonate her for her co-op shift. Abbis version of Ilana, it turns out, is hysterically crude and offensive, like Ilana seen through the eyes of her meanest Internet enemy: in a mesh crop top and those Latina earrings, Abbi-as-Ilana squeezes her breasts, howls Rape culture sucks!, and moans Yaaas! When a white woman assigns her to clean the bathroom, Abbi-as-Ilana explains earnestly that she and the woman are queens and should not be in the back of the bus, cleaning up white dudes dreadlocks, ja feel?

Its a provocative, unsettling routine that hits from multiple angles. Theres Abbis surprisingly harsh view of her friend. (Ilana isnt any better at doing Abbi: she mewls, Hi. Im Abbi. I love pugs. My fahmily comes from a long line of Colonial Jews.) The bit mocks white women, like Ilana, who glom on to black politics. And it suggests a cathartic, ongoing wrestling match with the shows own tricksy position, drawing a line between this coarse and manipulative Ilana and the endearing hustler whom fans love. Its the type of meta-comedy that TV sitcoms often experiment with once they are no longer novelties, when the creators have begun to engage, consciously or unconsciously, in a conversation with viewers responses.

All of which would be self-indulgent if it werent for the fact that the episode is non-stop funny. The clever dialogue revs it up, but the jokes click in because of the sheer anarchic strangeness of Jacobsons performance, as she masturbates an eggplant and falls backward into a display of bulk beans, mid-twerk. The shows secret engine, however, may be its willingness to tiptoe close to failure. Theres an argument that any critique of comedy is a joke-killer. But great comedians dont fold and sulk when people raise questionsthey just make better bits and bolder, more ambitious jokes. Vulnerability is strength! And a nervous laugh is also a laugh, after all. "
"111","Learn Different.txt",2171,7113,363,"Seen from the outside, AltSchool Brooklyn, a private school that opened in Brooklyn Heights last fall, does not look like a traditional educational establishment. There is no playground attached, no crossing guard at the street corner, and no crowd of children blocking the sidewalk in the morning. The school is one floor up, in a commercial building overlooking Montague Street. On the buildings exterior is a logo: a light-blue square, with rounded corners, bearing the word alt. It looks like an iPhone app awaiting the tap of a colossal finger.

Inside, the space has been partitioned with dividers creating several classrooms. The dcor evokes an IKEA showroom: low-slung couches, beanbags, clusters of tables, and wooden chairs in progressively smaller sizes, like those belonging to Goldilockss three bears. There is no principals office and no principal. Like the five other AltSchools that have opened in the past three yearsthe rest are in the Bay Areathe school is run by teachers, one of whom serves as the head of the school. There is no school secretary: many administrative matters are handled at AltSchools headquarters, in the SOMA district of San Francisco. There arent even many children. Every AltSchool is a micro-school. In Brooklyn Heights, there are thirty-five students, ranging from pre-kindergarten to third grade. Only a few dozen more children will be added as the school matures. AltSchools ambition, however, is huge. Five more schools are scheduled to open by the end of 2017, in San Francisco, Manhattan, and Chicago, and the goal is to expand into other parts of the country, offering a highly tailored education that uses technology to target each students needs and passions. Tuition is about thirty thousand dollars a year.

In December, I visited a classroom for half a dozen pre-kindergartners. Several children were playing restaurant, and one girl sat in a chair, her arms outstretched as if holding a steering wheel: she was delivering food orders. Im taking a shortcut, she announced. A teacher sitting on the floor told her, Thats a good wordyou used it correctly. Then she took out her phone and recorded a video of the moment.

Another teacher and a student were looking at a tablet computer that displayed an image of a pink jellyfish. The girl had been drawing her own jellyfish with a violet crayon. Lets see if we can learn a name of a new jellyfish, the teacher said. Which one do you want to learn more about? She touched the screen, and another jellyfish appeareda feathery white one. This is a . . . hippopodius? the teacher read, stumbling over the name. I wonder if this one glows in the dark. The girl said, Do you have another pink one?

Students at AltSchool are issued a tablet in pre-K and switch to a laptop in later years. (For now, AltSchool ends at the equivalent of eighth grade.) When I visited a mixed classroom for second and third graders, most of the children were sunk into their laptops. All were engaged in bespoke activities that had been assigned to them through a playlistsoftware that displays a series of digital cards containing instructions for a task to be completed. Sometimes it was an online task. Two children were doing keyboarding drills on a typing Web site. Their results would be uploaded for a teachers assessment and added to the students online Learning Progressionsoftware developed by AltSchool which captures, in minute detail, a students progress.

The curriculum is roughly aligned with the Common Core, the government standards that establish topics which students should master by the end of each grade. But AltSchools ethos is fundamentally opposed to the paradigm of standardization that has dominated public education in recent decades, and reflects a growing shift in emphasis among theorists toward personalized learning. This approach acknowledges and adapts to the differences among students: their abilities, their interests, their cultural backgrounds.

A girl in the class was completing an offline taskreading a book about polar bears. A boy lay on his stomach on the carpeted floor, headphones on, using a Web site called BrainPOP to learn how to calculate the perimeters of basic shapes. Two out of five! he shouted at one point, as oblivious of those around him as a subway rider wearing earbuds and singing along to Drake.

Not all the activities were solitary. Two girls sat together, laptops before them, using Google Images to scroll through pictures of seals for a social-studies assignment; occasionally, they paused to compare notes. Every so often, a student spoke with the teacher, a young woman in jeans and a loose top, her iPhone tucked under her thigh as she sat on the carpet. One girl had been using her laptop to research castlesan area of sustained interest. She and the teacher discussed princesses and castles, and whether they always went together. Thats a good question, the teacher said, and then asked, Does America have princesses?

A girl working nearby said, Yesmy mom told me there was a princess and she died because of the paparazzi.

My mom says that every castle has got a torture place, the girl who was studying castles said.

What is a castle?that was your starting question today, the teacher said. After the girl wrote a response, on paper, the teacher snapped a photograph of the page, in order to upload it to the girls playlist card.

She might also send it to a parents phone, using AltSchool Stream, an app that enables instant communication between home and school. Meanwhile, above the students heads, a network of white audio recorders hung from the ceiling, and fish-eye lenses were embedded in the walls. The goal of this surveillance system, AltVideo, is to capture every word, action, and interaction, for potential analysis.

Does every castle have torture? the teacher said, her voice sounding sunny, if a bit distracted. Thats a good starting question for tomorrow.

Max Ventilla, AltSchools thirty-five-year-old founder, is a native New Yorker who attended Buckley, on the Upper East Side, and proceeded to Andover, the New England prep school. He went to Yale, where he majored in math and physics, and then earned an M.B.A. Ventilla worked briefly for Google, then launched a startup, Aardvark, which developed a tool for social searchthe ability to direct a question to a targeted group of people. In 2010, he sold the company to Google, reportedly for fifty million dollars. Ventilla rejoined Google as a group product manager, and eventually became responsible for creating a unity of experience across the companys productsinsuring that, say, a users search results are informed by her YouTube browsing history. When Ventilla quit Google to start AltSchool, in the spring of 2013, he had no experience as a teacher or an educational administrator. But he did have extensive knowledge of networks, and he understood the kinds of insights that can be gleaned from big data.

The first AltSchool opened that September, in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco. The idea grew out of the search that Ventilla and his wife, Jenny Stefanotti, a former Google executive, conducted to find a preschool for their daughter, who is now four. (They also have a two-year-old son.) It was a startlingly miserable experience, he told me. You are thrown into this high-stakes world of trying to get your two-year-old into a school, and all the places that are desirable have a hundred times more people applying than they admit, and if you dont pick your preschool right your child will be penniless and alone at thirty. And there is, absurdly, a little bit of truth to that. While visiting schools, Ventilla was struck by how little education had changed since he began school. A three-year-old today isnt that different, he told me. But, largely because of technology, a thirteen-year-old is really different.

The more Ventilla thought about education, the more he thought that he could bring about changeand not just for his own children. Instead of starting a one-off school, he would create an educational ecosystem that was unusually responsive to the interests of children, feeding them assignments tied to subjects they cared about. Ventillas vision fit the prevailing ethos of middle-class child rearing, in which offspring are urged to find their enthusiasms and pursue them into rewarding nonconformity.

Ventilla also wanted students to focus on developing skills that would be useful in the workplace of the future, rather than forcing them to acquire knowledge deemed important by historical precedent. Kids should be spending less time practicing calculating by hand today than fifty years ago, because today everyone walks around with a calculator, Ventilla told me. That doesnt mean you shouldnt be able to do mathI shouldnt have to whip out my phone to figure out if someone gave me the correct change. But you should shift the emphasis to what is relatively easier, or what is relatively more important. Ventilla loves languageshis parents are Hungarian, and he grew up bilingual before studying French and Latin in school. He later learned some Persian, so that he could understand what a girlfriends family was saying about him at the dinner table. But hes not certain that his daughter should devote similar energy to language acquisition. If the reason you are having your child learn a foreign language is so that they can communicate with someone in a different language twenty years from nowwell, the relative value of that is changed, surely, by the fact that everyone is going to be walking around with live-translation apps, he said.

I recently toured the Dogpatch facility, which is situated in a former industrial building near the waterfront. It was basically put together with spit and toilet paper, Carolyn Wilson, one of AltSchools founding teachers, who is now the companys director of education, told me. Today, the company employs more than a hundred and fifty people, split evenly among educators, technologists, and operations managers. This rapid growth has been funded by a hundred and ten million dollars in venture capitaland twenty million in venture debtthat has been raised over the past two years, among the largest investments ever made in education technology. AltSchools capital comes from some of Silicon Valleys top investors, including the Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, and John Doerr. Last year, the philanthropic Silicon Valley Community Foundation invested fifteen million dollars in AltSchool, through a fund financed by Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan. (Currently, tuition fees cover most of the expenses of running the schools, including teacher salaries; the investment money helps cover technologists salaries, real-estate costs, and other expenditures related to the companys growth.) None of these backers want merely to own part of a chain of boutique micro-schools. Rather, they hope that AltSchool will help reinvent American education: first, by innovating in its micro-schools; next, by providing software to educators who want to start up their own schools; and, finally, by offering its software for use in public schools across the nation, a goal that the company hopes to achieve in three to five years.

Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are convinced that the flexibility and innovation of the tech sphere can be productively and profitably applied to the education sector, which is perceived as sclerotic. Sal Khan, who in 2005 founded Khan Academy, the popular online math-tutorial platform, says, Most of the people who end up doing well in Silicon Valley did very well academically, but they often have a very strong viewpoint about how it could have been better.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has poured billions of dollars into education grants, including for research on digital tools and personalized learning. Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, has made education a priority for her charitable organization, the Emerson Collective, pledging fifty million dollars to fund innovation in high-school education. (The Emerson Collective is an investor in AltSchool.) Mark Zuckerberg made a much publicized investment of a hundred million dollars in the public schools of Newark, although, as the journalist Dale Russakoff has chronicled, much of it was wasted. Facebook has been more successful in offering coding assistance to Summit, a chain of charter schools in the Palo Alto area; this year, Summits free software, called the Personalized Learning Plan, has been introduced in nineteen pilot schools nationwide.

AltSchool is what Silicon Valley people call a full-stack company, meaning that it is not just concerned with software. Most education-technology startups do not operate any schools. (Khan Academy has a single school, in Mountain View, but expanding its bricks-and-mortar operation is not a priority for the company.) Companies that are a hybrid of the virtual and the actual, like Uber or Airbnb or AltSchool, are particularly in vogue among Silicon Valley investors.

Facebook started as, essentially, a bulletin board for Harvard students, Ventilla told me. Uber started as a private chauffeur that GarrettGarrett Camp, Ubers founderhired and rode around with. This is a relatively common occurrence. You start in a very narrow way that you control and that really represents a kind of fundamentally different approach. And then you iterate.

Two years ago, AltSchool Fort Mason opened in the Marina District of San Francisco, on a commercial strip next to a Starbucks. When I stopped by, in December, children in the lower grades were being entertained by a startlingly tall blond woman dressed in a very short dress of Russian folk design. She was impersonating Snegurochka, the Snow Maiden, who visits children on New Years Eve. (It turned out that she was a students mother.) Upstairs in the middle school, the class was engaged in a complex simulation of a society that is undergoing a financial crisis and is ruled by a pair of dictators. (The two teachers played the tyrants.) This group project, which combined math and civics, was part of a broader effort to study different forms of government and to learn how an economy works.

The classroom resembled a tech employees studio apartment: couches, bookcases, a flat-screen TV, a kitchen area. Bowls on the counter were filled with apple slices and blue corn chips. Each student was using a Chromebook. The lead teacher, Christie Seyfert, was an energetic young woman with green hair, but the students werent watching her. They were looking at her image on the TV screen, where her face and voice had been distorted to signal her role as dictator. In an earlier session, the students had drawn lots to determine their jobs in the simulated society. Some were sales supervisors, others secretaries; one boy was the C.E.O. of an oil company. Their task that day was to research their salaries online and figure out what their tax bracket should be, by consulting a list that was posted on a wall. They were using real-world data, but to liven up the proceedings their income would be paid in units of POoO (an acronym for Peoples Organization of Opportunity).

After Seyferts introduction, the students formed small groups. Several boys crowded around a couch, Googling salaries. Another group excitedly discussed the arbitrariness of the job assignments and the dictators instructions. Im going to form a union! a girl cried. Seyfert was pleased by the ferment.

Seyfert, who is twenty-eight, started her career with Teach for America, working among low-income students in San Jose. I started out thinking there was a way to close the achievement gap, she told me. It became clear to me, teaching in those neighborhoods, that by looking for standards to pull everyone up we are forgetting to address what the individual needs. We are forgetting to think about how kids learn and what they need to be successful in life.

In San Jose, students scores on annual state tests were made available only after the end of the school year. At AltSchool, Seyfert could keep tabs on her students daily, if not hourly, progress. Every task card on a students playlist is tagged to denote not just academic skills, like math and literacy, but also social and emotional skills.

Seyfert pulled up the Learning Progression spreadsheet of one of her students, a seventh grader. Grades from kindergarten to eighth grade were denoted on the X axis, and various subject areas on the Y axis. Areas of completed studysixth-grade math, for examplewere indicated by cells filled in with green. Areas the student was still working onseventh-grade science, for instancewere colored orange. In English, he was working well ahead of his expected grade level. Seyfert could click on each subject area to get more precise information about his progress. The effect was rather like opening an online report from a credit-card company that can show expenditures by categoryShopping, Travelas well as specific purchases. She could see how many articles the student had read on Newsela, a site that provides Associated Press articles edited for different reading levels. She could click to see the students scores on the quizzes that accompanied each article, and then go into the article itself to read his annotations and marginal notes.

Here and there a solitary orange cell indicated an area that the student had not yet mastered. A student might have been sick the week that his fifth-grade class consolidated its knowledge of fractions and might not quite have grasped the principle. If I notice he is really scoring low on a standard, I can go and look at the cards that assess that standard and see where the breakdown is happening, Seyfert explained.

At the same time, educators at AltSchool are discussing whether children really need to attain certain skills at particular stages of their educational development, as the Common Core implies. Seyfert thinks that it might be more useful to think of learning not as linear but as scrambled, like a torrent file on a computer: You can imagine all the things you need to learn, and you could learn it all out of order so long as you can zip it up at the end, and you are good to go.

Like other AltSchool teachers, Seyfert was drawn to the startup because of its ambition to make systemic change. Two or three times a week, she told me, she gives colleagues feedback about the schools digital tools. The Learner Profile, Stream app, and other tools are only about a year old, and AltSchools personalization still requires considerable human intervention. Software is updated every day. Carolyn Wilson, AltSchools director of education, told me, We encourage staff members to express their pain points, step up with their ideas, take a risk, fail forward, and fail fast, because we know we are going to iterate quickly. Other schools tend to move in geologic time. (Ventilla may question the utility of foreign-language acquisition, but fluency in the jargon of Silicon ValleyEnglish 2.0is required at AltSchool.)

Ventilla told me that these tools were central to a revised conception of what a teacher might be: We are really shifting the role of an educator to someone who is more of a data-enabled detective. He defined a traditional teacher as an artisanal lesson planner on one hand and disciplinary babysitter on the other hand. Educators are stakeholders in AltSchools eventual success: equity has been offered to all full-time teachers.

In Seyferts classroom, I spoke with Otto Craddock, the seventh grader whose Learning Progression I had glimpsed. He had been researching the job that he held in the simulation: secretary. His parents, an advertising consultant and an executive at BlackRock, had moved him from a well-regarded private school. Gorse Jeffries, his mother, told me that he had seemed listless. Otto said, At my old school, they were, like, O.K., you want to do architecture? Maybe in college you can do architecture. Here some people selected architecture, and we did a whole unit on architecture, and we built models and projects.

The previous day, Otto said, a guest teacher had come in to lead several students in a 3-D-modelling project, using a Web site called Tinkercad. We built little models onlinesome people built phone cases, or little towers, or yo-yos, Otto said. I built a toilet, because I thought it would be fun. It has lots of different componentsyou have the base, you have the seat, you have the back. He clicked to the site and pulled up his model. I was looking around at pictures of toilets online, he said. I think I want to make it a bit more shaped for your back. I also want really sanitary toilets. And I want to make it really comfy. Im quite bony, and Im small, and if they dont have a cushion they hurt. Eventually, Otto said, he planned to 3-D print his prototype: a model toilet, fashioned to his personal specifications and preferences.

One afternoon in December, two dozen AltSchool technologists gathered in a conference room at the companys headquarters for a hackathona concentrated session of brainstorming and coding. Some participants had laptops in front of them; others had curry or salad from the company kitchen. All but a few were male, and nobody looked older than forty.

The point of the hackathon was to sketch out in code potential solutions to robot tasksroutine aspects of a teachers job that dont require teaching skills. Kimberly Johnson, the head of product success and training, addressed the team. Basically, what we have told teachers is we have hired you for your creative teacher brains, and anytime you are doing something that doesnt require your creative teacher brain that a computer could be doing as well as or better than you, then a computer should do it, Johnson said.

Since the previous hackathon, three months earlier, teachers at AltSchool had filed more than a hundred digital tickets to Johnson, indicating how AltSchool software might be improved. Some teachers had asked for a more streamlined way to input data. Johnson acknowledged, It is a lot of work to go into each card and click the learning objective and click the score and click save. Its just four or five clicks, but it adds up. The teachers also wanted to enter assessment scores to groups of kids at once. If you say, I want to give all of these kids threes, and all of these kids fours, there must be an easy way to do that, Johnson said. I dont know what it would look like, but you could probably hack something together.

Teachers also wanted faster access to the video recordings of their classrooms, to better evaluate students breakthrough moments, or to see what was going wrong when the classroom grew disorderly. Currently, Johnson said, teachers were using Slack, the group-messaging app, to alert her when there was a moment in the classroom that they wished to review. Shed watch the footage in order to find the right clip to bookmark, then send a link to the teacher through e-mail. This process could take days. That would be a cool thing to automate, she said.

Technologists have been trying to transform the classroom for decades. In the late seventies, Seymour Papert, a pioneer of artificial intelligence at M.I.T., contended that childrens minds might be profoundly enriched by coding. A child who learns to program both acquires a sense of mastery over a piece of the most modern and powerful technology and establishes an intimate contact with some of the deepest ideas from science, from mathematics, and from the art of intellectual model building, Papert wrote in his book, Mindstorms, which was published in 1980.

Coding has become a familiar part of the curriculum, but computers are being used more and more for customized instruction. Jose Ferreira, the founder and C.E.O. of Knewton, an adaptive-learning platform that has raised more than a hundred million dollars in venture funding, recently compared his product to a robot tutor in the sky that can semi-read your mind and figure out what your strengths and weaknesses are, down to the percentile.

Studies of the effectiveness of online learning programs suggest that greater humility is in order. A 2010 meta-analysis commissioned by the Department of Education concluded that students whose teachers combined digital and face-to-face learning did somewhat better than students who were not exposed to digital tools, but there was a major caveat: the teachers who added digital tools were judged to be more effective educators in general.

In 2012, Teach to One, a program that incorporates software to guide middle-school students through a math curriculum, was adopted at seven schools nationwide, including some in New York City. After a year, results were mixed: one school made gains far better than the national average, one did far worse, and the remaining five were close to the national average. In the second year, the program was expanded, and the results were better: eleven schools made higher-than-average gains, two made gains significantly lower than the national average, and two performed at par. A report commissioned by Teach to One stressed that improved scores could not be attributed entirely to the software. Joel Rose, the co-founder of New Classrooms, the company that developed Teach to One, likes to use an alarming metaphor popular among Silicon Valley innovators: Youve got to build the plane while youre flying.

So far, Teach to One is limited to math. Machines have become quite good at measuring the acquisition of arithmetical operations, but they are much less good at quantifying such skills as creativity or flexibilitylet alone measuring less easily definable aspects of a humanistic education, such as literary appreciation or artistic sensibility or the development of empathy. A digital reading platform that embeds interactive vocabulary assessments and comprehension tests in literary texts may guide young readers to just right books, and may give teachers insight into their students reading stamina and their progression from one Lexile levela measure of literacyto another. It may even achieve the elusive goal of encouraging reluctant readers to become enthusiastic ones. The creators of one literacy tool, LightSail, report that many kids, especially boys, treat the embedded assessments as a competitive game, fist-pumping when they get a vocabulary word right. But, at least for now, no literacy tool can tell whether a reader laughed at The Mouse and the Motorcycle or wept over The Fault in Our Stars. Nor can an app weigh the value of those moments when a reader looks up from the digital page and stares into space. To a computer measuring keystrokes, a student zoning out because hes bored is indistinguishable from one who is moved by her book to imagine a world of her own.

Even ed-tech advocates have warned against an overzealous embrace of the digital and the measurable. Jennifer Carolan, a former teacher who is now an investor at Reach Capital, recently wrote on her blog, With all of the investment hype and entrepreneurial frenzy, I worry that some might view personalization as yet another silver bullet for education. There have already been several high-profile ed-tech failures. News Corp developed Amplify, an educational-software division, and appointed Joel Klein, the former New York schools chancellor, as its head, only to spin it off this fall after school districts declined to buy into it.

Unlike Amplify, AltSchool generates revenue by charging tuition. And in cities like San Francisco and New York it could prove a popular option for the many families who opt out of the public system. About a quarter of AltSchool students receive financial aid. To provide students with a school experience that prepares them for the future, we need classrooms that are representative of the diversity in our country, Ventilla says. AltSchools technological schemes, however, may be very hard to implement in less affluent public school districts. A child who doesnt have wireless Internet access at home cant do homework on a tablet, even if her school provides one.

Some education advocates are wary about potential privacy violations that might result from data collection on the scale intended by AltSchool, particularly given that AltSchool is a for-profit company. (Most independent schools are not-for-profit institutions.) These concerns could complicate the adoption of AltSchool software by public school systems. Ventilla says that there is no intention to use AltSchool data for commercial purposes, and that AltSchool can gather data in a way that will respect a students anonymity. Only salient moments in the classroom videos are saved, he says, and most are not even stored. I would never want to record all the things a kid says and keep them around, he said. But he added that looking at vocabulary-acquisition patterns in aggregate could provide teachers with valuable information that will help them teach each individual more effectively. The collection of any kind of data is not free, Ventilla acknowledged. But the alternative is the incredibly invasive, inaccurate standardized-testing regimen that we have now, which comes at a lot of cost, psychic and otherwise, and doesnt provide nearly the amount of benefit that we want.

Daniel Willingham, an education scholar at the University of Virginia, told me that adopting technology in schools can be maddeningly inefficient. The most common thing I hear is that when you adopt technology you have to write twice the lesson plans, he told me. You have the one you use with the technology, and you have the backup one you use when the technology doesnt work that day. Willingham also notes that the most crucial thing about educational software isnt the code that assesses student performance; its the worthiness of the readings and the clarity of the math questions being presented onscreen. People are very focussed on the algorithm, he said. But equally important is the quality of the materials.

The gap between AltSchools ambitions for technology and the reality of the classroom was painfully obvious the morning that I spent in the Brooklyn school. One kindergartner grew increasingly frustrated with his tablet as he tried to take a photograph of interlocking cubes that he had snapped into a strip of ten. (He was supposed to upload the image to his playlist.) He shook the unresponsive tablet, then stabbed repeatedly at the screen, like an exhausted passenger in a cab after an overnight flight, unable to quell the Taxi TV.

Even when AltSchools methods worked as intended, there were sometimes questionable results. The two girls whom I watched searching for seals on Google Images found plenty of suitable photographs. But the same search term called up a news photo of the corpse of a porpoise, its blood blossoming in the water after being rent almost in half by a seal attack. It also called up an image in which the head of Seal, the singer, had been Photoshopped onto a sea lions bodyan object of much fascination to the students. To the extent that this exercise was preparing them for the workplace of the future, it was also dispiritingly familiar from the workplace of the present, where the rabbit holes of the Internet offer perpetual temptation.

Under Arne Duncan, who resigned as Secretary of Education in 2015 after six years in the post, U.S. schools deployed an ever-expanding regimen of standardized tests, and Common Core was widely adopted. The goal was to improve the assessment of student learning and teacher performance through the collection of data and the use of shared standards. But toward the end of his tenure Duncan acknowledged that the pressures of high-stakes testing had deformed classroom practices, to the detriment of students and teachers alike. His resignation may mark the beginning of the end of thirty years of standards-based education reform.

Meanwhile, there is a rise in interest among parents and educators about habits of success. Qualities like grit and resilience, and how to cultivate them, are much discussed in contemporary educational theory, and teachers increasingly speak of meeting children where their abilities and interests lie. Among educational theorists, one of the buzzwords is blended learningin which students receive content from a combination of classroom lectures and software.

AltSchool families might be described as early adopters of this new paradigm. Ventilla is wary of the characterization. No one who likes gadgets chooses to send a kid to a school because its newit is such a meaningful, high-intensity purchase, he told me. Still, Don MacAskill, a parent at AltSchool Palo Alto, told me, We are very comfortable with our kids being guinea pigs. I do buy into the AltSchool mission. I believe education needs to change, not just in our little micro-school here but all over the world. We are raising a generation that will have the sum of human knowledge at their fingertips, for every minute of their life, so clearly education needs to change to accommodate that.

I met MacAskill and several other parents one day after school. He and his wife, Liz, were wearing sweatshirts bearing the logo of SmugMug, a photo-sharing startup. MacAskill is its co-founder and chief geek. He knew Ventilla from tech circles, and recalls, We ran into each other a couple of years ago, and he said, Im doing this great thing to revolutionize education. I said, Wow, that sounds like a big hard job, dude. Good luckI cant wait to watch. And then our kids started to grow up. The three MacAskill childrenLeia, named for the princess; Logan, named for the X-Men character; and Audrey, named for Hepburnhad been in public schools, but MacAskill said, Once our twins got into third grade, some of the issues around non-personalized learning really sort of kicked in.

There had been some bumpy moments for the Palo Alto school, which opened last fall. One family left after concluding that there wasnt enough homework. Other parents wanted to know the curriculum in advancean impossible demand in a school dedicated to following childrens interests. A look around the classrooms confirmed that for some children the ability to follow their own passions reaped rich dividends. I observed the kindergarten-and-first-grade classroom during afternoon choice time, and saw two children separately involved in complicated long-term projects. A seven-year-old boy with an avid interest in American history had built a dining-table-sized model of Fort Sumter out of cardboardhe was painting black-splotch windows on its perimeter. He had also composed a storybook about Paul Revere, which was vibrantly written, if impressionistically spelled. Another seven-year-old boy had undertaken a physics experiment, building two styles of catapult out of tongue depressors and tape. He was measuring their power with the help of a yardstick affixed to the wall, and recording the data in a notebook. The AltSchool environmentand an inspiring young teacher named Paul Francehad liberated these childrens individual creativity and intellectual curiosity in just the way that the parents of a potential Elon Musk might hope.

The boys classmates, however, had made less demanding use of their choice time, and this had apparently allowed the teaching staff to provide the necessary support for the more ambitious projects. Four boys were seated on the floor making primitive catapults with Jenga blocks. Half a dozen girls had chosen art creation, and were sitting around a table affixing stickers to paper and chatting. One girl had opted to work in clay. But no students had chosen to engage in dramatic play, or to work at the light table, or to do jigsaw puzzlesoptions that were displayed on a wall chart. The remaining eight childrensix boys and two girlshad selected tablet time. They were sitting around a table, each with headphones on, expertly swiping and clicking their way through word or number games. Their quiet immersion would be recognizable to any parent who has ever bought herself a moments peace from the demands of interacting with her child by opening Angry Birds on her phone.

Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts, Thomas Gradgrind, the rigid schoolteacher in Charles Dickenss Hard Times, declares. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. Dickenss novel was a satire of the philosophy of utilitarianism as it was applied to education: the idea that working-class children needed to know enough to work in factories and nothing more.

Personalized education promises an escape from the more recent Gradgrindian practice of standardized tests. In a world of personalized learning, the argument goes, every childs particular genius will be permitted to shine. But AltSchools philosophy of education is also essentially utilitarian, even as it celebrates the individuality, autonomy, and creativity of its students. It holds that children should be prepared for the workplace of the futureand that the workplace of the future will demand individuality, creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.

AltSchools perspective does not necessarily require abandoning texts that have long been considered central to a humanist education, but it does mean approaching them anew. One middle-school class undertook a lengthy study of the Iliad by focussing on the theme of rage and designing a spreadsheet that logged instances of it. They then used data-visualization techniques to show their findings, and wrote persuasive essays based on their results. Afterward, their teacher, James Earle, wrote, Analyzing a piece of literature this way turns the work into a piece of robust data that can be understood quantitatively, in addition to allowing a qualitative reading. The workplace of the future, according to AltSchools premise, will look a lot like some workplaces in the presentplaces like Google and Facebook, where Gradgrinds faith in facts is matched by faith in the revelatory power of data.

Last spring, AltSchool hired Bharat Mediratta, a ten-year Google veteran, as chief technology officer. Mediratta had been running part of the search infrastructure that powered Googles home page. I met with him in an AltSchool office in San Francisco, and he told me, When I joined Google, no one wanted to work on this projectit was literally the worlds largest Web app, but it was mostly me doing infrastructure. And when I left I had built a team of two hundred to two hundred and fifty people.

Joining Mediratta was Rajiv Bhatia, AltSchools vice-president of productoverseeing its software development. He previously worked at Zynga, the company behind Farmville and other online games. I feel a little bit better about working on something a little bit more noble, he said. Selling virtual sheep was fun, and getting better at it was great, and I do feel the principles and constructs of reacting to what your users need, and what the market is asking you to do, is useful here. Mediratta, too, was motivated to join AltSchool by the opportunity to have greater social impact. For us to complete our mission, we need to get to the fifty million kids in public school, he said. So far, AltSchools data pool was small, and not particularly actionable. But, Mediratta went on, Raj and I both come from big-data backgrounds. We have this deep belief that, as we start pulling in data, we will be able to find ways to help teachers and improve the system.

Both men were particularly excited about the data that might be gathered through AltVideo. It allows the teacher to be what I like to call retroactively omniscient,  Mediratta said. He noted that a teacher could unobtrusively observe a student who had taken a long time completing an assignment and determine if he had been struggling or goofing off. The video also allows the AltSchool real-estate team to discern how to improve the layout of its schools. Bhatia clicked on his laptop to show me a recording that had been made in a classroom the previous morning as students were settling in. We are hoping to be able to use it to make inferenceslike what peer groups exist in the classroom, he said. (Pity the student who tries to pass notes under AltVideos watchful eye.)

Mediratta envisaged a time when AltSchool technology would get into the sci-fi realm. What insights might be drawn from aggregated data culled from video and audio? He spoke of the video moments that teachers were bookmarking. The next useful thing would be for us to analyze all the things that are bookmarked, and to draw inferences, Mediratta said. Like, bookmarks seem to happen when the classroom is noisy. So lets generate a few other interesting moments that the teacher might want to look atsay, a moment when the classroom was full of kids but was dead quiet. What was happening there? Is this good? Is this bad? Or you could look at a moment when it was absolutely chaoticbut maybe that is what the activity called for. So we can start applying machine learning to this data to start driving inferences. Maybe what we should be doing is detecting when the classroom gets noisy, and then we could have the head of the school, who is also an educator, stop by your classroom and participate and help.

When the AltSchool technologists who participated in the December hackathon shared their discoveries at the end of the session, the team that had focussed on bookmarking video seemed particularly pleased with its innovations. The team had decided to try to find a fun route to help teachers request a video clip of a moment in class. The idea is that the teacher could, in theory, just knock twice on their phone, one team member said. He patted twice on his device, which was buried in the front pocket of his jeans, to demonstrate the ease and unobtrusiveness of the gesture.

Another member of the team tapped on his laptop, and a graph that resembled an echocardiogram, with troughs and spikes, appeared on a large video screen at the head of the table. A third team member, a young man with a starter beard, tapped twice on his phone, and the graph reappeared with a new spikethe result of his tapping.

There were cheers around the room as the developers explained how they had filtered the data so that the jostling motions of a teacher walking upstairs, say, would not show up as a bookmark. Its reasonably robust, one said, with pride. Someone asked about a cluster of spikes on the graph. That was, I dont knowme digging around with the phone in my pocket, came the answer.

From the back of the room, a woman spoke up: Did you test it with a female?

Many participants laughed. Im serious, the questioner went on. A lot of our teachers are females, and they carry phones in different places.

The members of the bookmark team, all of whom were male, looked deflated. In coming up with their apparently elegant solution, they had not visualized a female teacher slapping her bottom to activate a phone tucked into her back pocket.

Thats a really good point, one of them acknowledged, his smile waning. Yeah, it could use a lot of fine-tuning. This was just, like, hey, get ourselves to a demo. They had failed fast and failed forward. That was what they were supposed to do. Tomorrow, they would iterate. "

This introduction to circuit design is unusual in several respects. First, it offers not just explanations, but a full course. Each of the twenty-five sessions begins with a discussion of a particular sort of circuit followed by the chance to try it out and see how it actually behaves. Accordingly, students understand the circuits operation in a way that is deeper and much more satisfying than the manipulation of formulas. Second, it describes circuits that more traditional engineering introductions would postpone: on the third day, we build a radio receiver; on the fifth day, we build an operational amplifier from an array of transistors.

"113","Legos toy empire keeps growing one plastic brick at a time.txt",169,260,13,"Ten years ago, Lego was barely turning a profit. Today, the brick maker is leaving toy makers Mattel and Hasbro in the dust.

Lego posted stellar profits on Tuesday (March 1) with strong sales for Star Wars sets and the new Dimensions video game, which merges physical brick building with console gaming. The Denmark-based toymakers net profits increased 31% to 9.2 billion Danish kronor ($1.34 billion) during 2015, up from 7 billion kronor a year earlier. Thats more than the combined profits of American toymakers Mattel and Hasbro, which are rumored to be considering a merger.

Legos sales have grown faster than its rivals in the last two years. Last year Legos net revenue rose 25% to 35.8 billion kroner, or roughly $5.2 billion, while Mattels sales fell 5% to $5.7 billion, and Hasbros grew 4% to $4.45 billion.

The companys performance in 2015 is a huge triumph when you consider how far the 84-year-old brand has come. Lego went from managing a huge deficit in 2004 to becoming the worlds fifth largest toymaker in terms of sales in 2009. Lego is now vying for first place.

Whats the explanation? New product innovations, partnerships with major brands like Disney, whose properties are among Legos best sellers, and projects like The Lego Movie, which helped boost the demand for bricks beginning in 2014. Mattel meanwhile has struggled with falling demand for the Barbie brand and competition from Hasbro, which has attached itself to recent film releases such as Jurassic World, The Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
"114","Leicester City 2-2 West Bromwich Albion.txt",436,1028,65,"Leicester were twice denied by the woodwork as well as by saves from Ben Foster

Leicester missed the chance to go five points clear at the top of the Premier League as West Brom came from behind to claim a thrilling draw.

Salomon Rondon shrugged off Robert Huth to give West Brom the lead, but a Danny Drinkwater deflected shot levelled it.

Andy King finished a wonderful move to put Leicester ahead only for Craig Gardner to equalise with a free-kick.

Leicester twice hit the bar at a raucous King Power Stadium, but could not find a winner.

The draw leaves the Foxes three points ahead of Tottenham, who can go top with victory at West Ham on Wednesday, and six ahead of Arsenal, who face Swansea.

West Brom, who have now lost only two of their past 10 league games, stay 13th - 12 points clear of the relegation zone.

Relive Leicester's thrilling draw with West Brom

No more late drama

Media playback is not supported on this device No negatives despite a draw - Ranieri

Leicester were below their best on Saturday but still managed to beat Norwich thanks to a late winner - here they were much improved, but could not conjure similar drama despite laying siege to the West Brom goal.

West Brom may have planned to concede possession and defend deep, and they were duly bombarded by wave after wave of Leicester attacks, mainly down the flanks through the excellent pair of Riyad Mahrez and Marc Albrighton.

On Saturday, the Foxes had 13 attempts on goal - here they had 22, with headers from Jamie Vardy and Shinji Okazaki hitting the woodwork.

Ben Foster also saved well from Jeffrey Schlupp and Wes Morgan, while Leonardo Ulloa could not repeat his weekend heroics when the ball flashed across the face of goal in the very last minute.

Baggies forced out of their shell

Eight of West Brom's 11 attempts on goal came in the second half

West Brom could have been forgiven for thinking that allowing Leicester the lion's share of possession was a sound approach.

Against Norwich, Leicester had the majority of the ball for only the third time this season and struggled. Whether by design or necessity, the Baggies were happy to sit back in the first period, especially after Rondon got on the end of Darren Fletcher's through ball to put the visitors ahead.

However, even with nine red shirts behind the ball, Leicester still found a way to lead, meaning West Brom had to make more of the play in the second half. It worked to their advantage as, after Mahrez needlessly handballed, Gardner curled in a sublime free-kick.

Rondon could even have won it but somehow turned over from inside the six-yard box, and the Baggies ultimately needed some fortune to hang on at the end of a breathless night.

King of the King Power

King (10) finished from Mahrez's wonderful back-heel following a cross-field ball from Albrighton

King was making only his seventh league start of the season, in the side for the injured N'Golo Kante.

The Welsh midfielder is the only member of the Foxes squad remaining from their time in the third tier seven years ago and has winners' medals from both League One and the Championship.

Here he looked to have taken a stride towards adding a Premier League medal when he met Mahrez's athletic back-heel to finish sharply past Foster.

But in the end the odds on King completing an unlikely hat-trick lengthened - and Leicester could be back to second in the table as early as Wednesday night.

Man of the match

Marc Albrighton was a constant threat down the Leicester left before being substituted

What they said

Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri: ""I am very pleased with our performance. They played so well - there was no panic after the first goal. We played much better than against Norwich. I am satisfied with the performance. Just sometimes you can do everything but the ball doesn't want to go in.

""I want to create a lot of chances and sooner or later we score. Tonight wasn't the right moment but we are alive and we fight to the end. Everybody is ready to fight, to play well, to create chances. Only the victory was missing.

""We tried to do everything and well done to my players. We never never give up. We always try the best in every situation. Every team plays football and we have to find the solution and try to win. It is important not to lose the match too as they could have counter-attacked.""

Media playback is not supported on this device Pulis happy with Baggies' form

West Brom manager Tony Pulis: ""Leicester are a good side. They ask questions of you.

""It's another point on the way for us. It's important for us to get to 40 points and we are happy with the way things are going. We need the hunger and desire to get to 40 points. We should have kept the ball better tonight. I'm really pleased with the players though.

""I'd love to see Leicester win the title.""

The stats

Leicester are the first Premier League team this season to score 50+ goals in the competition.

Two of Leicester's three top-flight goals from outside the area this season have been scored by Danny Drinkwater.

Leicester's record as the only Premier League side not to concede at home in 2016 ended.

Riyad Mahrez has had a part in a league-high 25 Premier League goals this season (14 goals, 11 assists).

Salomon Rondon has scored in three of his past five Premier League games, having failed to score in his previous nine in the competition.

Andy King is the fourth Welshman to score on St David's Day in Premier League history (also Pembridge, Saunders and Collison).

Craig Gardner has had a role in three of the Baggies' last five Premier League goals (scored two, assisted one).

Gardner has also scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since last April (also v Palace and Leicester).

What's next?

Leicester travel to Watford on Saturday, while West Brom welcome Manchester United on Sunday."

"116","Living-Room Democracy.txt",1575,5281,307,"This past fall in El-Balyana, a remote district in Upper Egypt, there were nineteen candidates for two seats in the new national parliament, and none of them seemed to enjoy the campaign more than Yusuf Hasan Yusuf. He was a big man in his mid-forties, with smooth, dark skin that was set off by a white galabia. He had nine children, a jewelry shop, and a farm where he grew wheat, corn, and sugarcane. He campaigned entirely door-to-doorin his opinion, public political activity served no purpose. If you have those rallies, its fake, Yusuf told me. He had no platform, and he didnt talk about issues, policies, or potential legislation. He never made a single public campaign promise. In the past, he hadnt enjoyed the support of any party or other institution, and yet he had built a successful political career. Once, I asked a rival candidate how he did it.

Yusuf is lucky, he said, somewhat grudgingly. Yusuf is a simple, kind man, and hes lucky.

Yusuf first won a seat in parliament in December of 2010. Running as an independent, he defeated the local candidate from the National Democratic Party, which had ruled a de-facto one-party state for more than thirty years. Less than two months later, the revolution began on Tahrir Square, and soon President Hosni Mubarak resigned from office, the parliament was cancelled, and the N.D.P. was disbanded. Afterward, Islamists were allowed to form political parties for the first time, and they won more than seventy per cent of the seats in the next parliamentary campaign, in the winter of 2011-12. In El-Balyana, though, Yusuf received many more votes than the local candidate from the Muslim Brotherhoods political organization, the Freedom and Justice Party. Once again, Yusuf travelled to Cairo to take office, and once again the parliament was soon cancelled, this time by a court order. In the summer of 2013, after nationwide protests, the military forcibly removed the countrys first democratically elected President, Mohamed Morsi, who had been a leader of the Brotherhood, which was quickly banned as a terrorist organization.

When I asked Yusuf what he had learned from these events, he had trouble answering, and I realized that the question assumed a logic that doesnt apply to Egypt. From Yusufs perspective, losers of elections tended to see their organizations banned or dissolved, whereas winners joined a lawmaking body that also tended to be banned or dissolved. I didnt know what really happened, whether it was a legitimate court order or something else, Yusuf said, of the cancellation of the second parliament. Since then, the government had repeatedly delayed elections, and Egypt had had no parliament for three years. In the meantime, Yusuf continued to do what he does best. Im always campaigningit never stops, he told me last June, months before the new elections had even been scheduled. Two other local parliamentarians had remained on leave from their jobs since 2012, in part so that they could campaign more or less continuously.

El-Balyana sits on the Niles western bank, about three hundred miles upstream from Cairo, where the narrow river valley is surrounded by high, barren bluffs. Beyond the bluffs, in both directions, the desert is uninhabitable across all of North Africa. Upper Egypt is densely settledabout forty per cent of Egyptians live in the southand its the poorest and the most neglected part of the country. Over the years, Upper Egyptians have responded to national dysfunction by effectively creating their own system for elections. Even under N.D.P. rule, Upper Egyptians developed local versions of parties, and they devised indigenous campaign traditions. This informal system survived both the Arab Spring and its aftermath; in some respects, its as stable as any other Egyptian political institution. These southern election campaigns reflect how, in a repressive but weak state, the problem isnt just the ways in which the government prevents political freedom. Its also the flawed organizations that people build when left entirely to their own devices.

In El-Balyana, Yusufs main rival was Rafat Mohamed Mahmoud, who was his opposite in almost every respect. Rafat had belonged to the N.D.P., but after the revolution he became an independent; in 2012, he narrowly defeated the Brotherhood candidate for the districts second seat, behind Yusuf. For this election, Rafat had again changed affiliation: he joined the Free Egyptians Party, which had been founded by Naguib Sawiris, a Coptic Christian who is one of the richest men in the country. Rafat himself came from a wealthy extended family, known as the Abul Khair, and on the first evening that I observed his campaign he travelled around to private homes with an entourage of a dozen relatives, in a Mercedes sedan, a Jeep S.U.V., and two other vehicles.

One member of the entourage was in charge of terminating each home visit. His name was Abu Steit, and he was a short, pudgy man with a toothbrush mustache who carried a wooden cane and wore a turban. At every stop, the group was escorted into the dawar, the traditional rural Egyptian reception area, where the familys elders waited. At the entrance, the young men of the family had lined up to greet the visitors. Each of them offered a cigarette to every guestsometimes I was formally presented with twenty cigarettes in rapid succession. Throughout the visit, the young men brought trays of drinks for the elders, although Abu Steit often waved them off and shouted, Halawa!sweets. In Upper Egypt, social engagements run late, and by midnight I had lost track of how many chocolate bars Abu Steit had consumed. As his blood sugar rose, so did my fascination: there was something magnetic about a little man with a Hitler mustache who, after tossing away an empty candy wrapper, would suddenly pound his cane on the ground and yell, Al Fatiha! Al Fatiha! The Fatiha is the first Surah of the Koran, and it was recited to bless Rafats departure. A home visit might last for half an hour, or it could be finished in a minute; only Abu Steit seemed to know the appropriate duration.

Many visits were characterized by long stretches of silence. There was no stump speech or formal introduction, and Rafat rarely spoke. He was a tall man in an expensive pin-striped galabia, and often he sat in the place of honor, staring into space, until Abu Steit mercifully called for the Fatiha. Nobody ever mentioned Rafats N.D.P. past or his current political affiliation, whose benefit was primarily financial. In El-Balyana, a Cairo-based party like the Free Egyptians might pay for posters and other campaign expenses, but it had no local office or network. There was no functioning local press that allowed a party to promote specific issues or policies. This was one reason that candidates campaigned entirely door-to-door. El-Balyana consists of two small cities and thirty-three villages, with a population of around six hundred thousand, but candidates were able to cover this large region in part because they had started long before the official election season. On the fifth day of the campaign, I met a person whose home had already been visited by ten candidates.

Instead of parties, the campaign revolved around two local tribes: the Hawwara, to which Yusuf belonged, and the Arabs, a tribe that included Rafat. When I first began visiting El-Balyana, in early 2013, these groups impressed me as indistinguishable: they spoke the same dialect of Arabic; they dressed and lived the same way; they looked like members of the same ethnic group. All of them were Muslim; most of them were farmers. I had never thought of Egypt as having a tribal societyunlike other parts of the Middle East, its always been an agricultural country. But most people in El-Balyana were adamant that they had descended from nomadic tribes.

One prominent member of Rafats entourage was his cousin Souleiman Abul Khair, an actor who often plays Upper Egyptian roles on television. Late in the evening, the campaign visited a wealthy landowner named Zabit Gebr, an elder of his family, who asked Souleiman to find a good screenwriter to produce a script about their tribe. We want a serious soap opera that represents the Arabs, Zabit said. We want the guy who wrote the series Sheikh al-Arab Hamam,  he went on. But there was a problemhe described somebody from the Hawwara as if he were Arab. Zabit embarked on a long analysis of other shows that, in his opinion, also conflated tribes. He said that the Arabs needed to do a better job of establishing their identity in the entertainment industry. Keep raising our heads for all of Egypt, inshallah, he said to the actor.

Have you watched Khalaf Allah? Souleiman asked.

I just watched two episodes.

You have to watch it, because I play a good role.

Facebook ruined our eyesight. It has weakened my eyes, man.

In truth, the history of some tribes in Upper Egypt is a recent creation. During medieval times, some nomadic Bedouin groups, including the Hawwara, migrated from northwestern Africa. But they intermarried with natives and adopted local culture, and there were many other outsiders who also settled in the region, ranging from Greek traders to Turkish administrators. There had never been a tribe called the Arabsthe term was popularized in the nineteen-fifties, as part of Gamal Abdel Nassers pan-Arabism. In Upper Egypt, it replaced fellahin, or peasants, which had negative connotations.

During the past thirty years, though, the Arabs have been reimagined, along with other groups in the region. In the nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies, the tribes were not very important, Hans Christian Korsholm Nielsen, a Danish anthropologist who researches Upper Egyptian politics, told me. But they had an electoral system that needed some group, and the tribes came in handy. Mubarak had emphasized parliamentary elections as a way of claiming that Egypt was democratic, although the vote was often rigged in the major cities. But in the neglected south, Nielsen said, elections tended to run more freely, with the N.D.P. recruiting whoever happened to win. In this unstructured but competitive environment, where there were essentially no institutions, people naturally turned to the organization that they knew best: the family. They expanded the concept of tribal identity, sometimes creating elaborate backgrounds for groups that hadnt existed. Near the city of Aswan, Nielsen observed a candidate who enlisted a regional historian to lecture voters on their supposed tribal past.

In the north, a victorious politician could direct state funds toward projects that benefitted his supporters, but expectations were more modest in El-Balyana. During home visits, a voter sometimes asked a candidate to make a call on his behalf, usually to a government office that issued permits or handled utilities. This was part of the reason that the campaign was so personal: knowing that candidates had no institutional support, voters asked for only small favors. And yet Upper Egyptians seemed to care much more about the election than Cairenes did. Pride was a factor, and the campaigns also served to reinforce family structures. Egyptian families tend to be strictly hierarchical, especially in the south, where the elders clearly enjoyed barking orders at lines of young men.

They also expected to decide the votes of their family members. Zabit, the elder who asked about soap operas, told me that he directed six hundred people of voting age in his extended family. When I give the order on the day of the election, then the people have to go to the polling station and vote, he said. Its not their business whether its wrong or right. He told me that he didnt really care who won the election; for him, the main value seemed to be the opportunity to assert control over his clan. And he did this publiclythe day after our visit, Zabit announced on Facebook that his family would vote for Rafat.

In Egypt, the majority of the population is under the age of twenty-five. The autocratic behavior of male eldersordering drinks, dictating votes, wielding virtually all poweris even more striking in the light of their scarcity. Men aged fifty-five or older make up only 5.7 per cent of the population.

Large numbers of young Egyptians are underemployed or jobless, and they dominated the Tahrir protests in 2011. One of the revolutions demands was that the young be given a greater role in the political system. For the first parliamentary elections that followed, two-thirds of the seats were reserved for members of lists: candidates who shared party affiliations or other alliances, and whose ranks had to include people under the age of thirty-five, women, Christians, and other traditionally underrepresented groups.

During that campaign, the youngest Egyptian to win a list seat came from El-Balyana. He was a twenty-six-year-old named Mahmoud Hamdy Ahmed, and he was one of Rafats cousins and a member of the Abul Khair family. Unlike Rafat, who had established himself with the N.D.P., Mahmoud rose with the sudden proliferation of post-Tahrir parties. He joined the Nour Party, which represented the Salafi movement, a conservative strain of Islam that originated in the Persian Gulf region. Nour won about a quarter of the seats nationwide, and, together with the Muslim Brotherhood, it was seen as the vanguard of Egypts new political Islam.

But Nour representatives often clashed with Brotherhood members in parliament, and in July, 2013, when President Morsi was deposed, the leaders of the Nour endorsed the change. Later that summer, security forces massacred more than eight hundred Morsi supporters in Cairo, according to Human Rights Watch, and the violence alienated many grassroots members of the Nour. In 2015, when a government commission set the rules for the new parliamentary elections, it drastically reduced the number of list seats.

Over time, the Nour Party weakened, and Mahmoud renounced his membership and became an independent. But he kept the beard. No other candidate in El-Balyana appeared on posters with full Salafi facial hair, in which only the mustache is shaved. The beard is a powerful symbol, but local interpretations of Mahmouds ranged widely: some people said that he was a true fundamentalist, while others claimed that he was an opportunist who had briefly latched on to the Salafi movement before discarding it. In the past, the Abul Khair family hadnt been politically powerful, until some members went to Kuwait as guest workers in the nineteen-eighties and became rich enough to run big campaigns. By adopting a Salafi persona, Mahmoud had distanced himself from Rafat and his N.D.P. past. Village conspiracy theorists told me that the cousins used the veneer of national politics to distract from the most salient fact: that the Abul Khair family was rising to unprecedented local wealth and status.

When I first visited Mahmouds dawar, I found a tall, thin young man whose eyes reflected shrewdness and suspicion in equal measure. He had been trained as a pharmacist, a career that attracts bright students in Egypt. I interviewed him with a translator, but he seemed unwilling or unable to answer any specific questions about policies or potential legislation. This was common in El-Balyana, where candidates rarely had any meaningful experience with the press. But, when I asked Mahmoud why he had left the Nour Party, his response was blunt. The street wants candidates to be independent, he said. He insisted that he was neither a Salafi nor an Islamist. Here its a tribal system, he said. Theres the Hawwara and the Arabs, and thats it. Nothing else. No Islamists or non-Islamists.

Mahmoud campaigned in a Mercedes 200 sedan whose back window was decorated with his official symbol, a military cannon, along with the slogan Your Hand in My Hand . . . We Build for Your Children and for Mine. The campaign positioned wooden cannons at busy intersections in El-Balyana, and white plastic cannons, their muzzles pointed upward, were attached to the roofs of three-wheeled tuk-tuk cabs, which cruised around town like an undersized cavalry.

Campaign symbols are mandatory because more than a quarter of Egyptians are illiterate. The rate in the south is even higherat some El-Balyana polling stations, judges told me that the majority of the voters couldnt read. In each district, the selection of symbols is like a fantasy draft, with candidates choosing from a hundred and sixty government-approved icons. Some of them seem to have dubious connotations: a knife, an ambulance, a scorpion. One option is a feather, like Dan Quayle in the old Doonesbury cartoons. This year, two candidates in greater Cairo were represented by a rifle and a megaphone. The top draft pick in El-Balyana was wasted on a chandelier, the political equivalent of the Knicks grabbing Renaldo Balkman. Mahmoud told me that he selected the cannon because the others had already been taken. But this made no sensehe had picked fourth. Still, I couldnt help but be impressed by a reformed Islamist who showed up for the first post-coup parliamentary election sporting a cannon and a Salafi beard. Given the security climate, it seemed every bit as brave as the Cairo candidate who campaigned under the slogan No to Terrorism.

In El-Balyana, during the first year after the revolution, Morsi won a broad majority in the Presidential election, and the Muslim Brotherhoods Freedom and Justice candidate was just behind Rafat for the second non-list parliamentary seat. For most of its history, the Brotherhood had been banned, but it had a reputation for charity and grassroots organizing. In elections, it performed well across Upper Egypt, which was often described as a Brotherhood stronghold.

But in El-Balyana the Brotherhood had only one small office, and I found no evidence of significant charitable activities. The same was true in most other parts of the south that I visited during the Morsi era. I came to believe that the Brotherhood was remarkably weak, and it won elections only because there was no organized competition. In April, 2013, I met with Ayman Abdel Hamid, a physician in El-Balyana and a Brotherhood leader who was slated to run in the next parliamentary election. He told me that there were only a hundred and fifty Brothers in the district.

Last summer, I visited Ayman again, at his small private clinic. In Cairo, its virtually impossible to meet Brothers, but Ayman told me that the local crackdown is lighter, in part because the family system insulates against national events. He said that only two Brothers from El-Balyana have been imprisoned, and he and others are left alone because they arent active in the Brotherhood anymore. He told me that poverty is also a factor in the gentler response from the state security forces. Since life is already hard, they dont want to make it harder, he said.

I reminded him that in 2013 he had told me there were a hundred and fifty local members. That was the crowd around the Brotherhood, not the real members, Ayman said. We were trying to exaggerate the numbers to scare other parties. It was just election tactics.

I asked what the real number had been.

Ten members, he said, and smiled sadly. Those were two of our mistakes. We exaggerated the number of our members to scare others. And we allowed some people to act like they were with us, but in truth they werent.

It seemed remarkable: in a district of around six hundred thousand, an organization with only ten local members had dominated the Presidential vote and nearly won a parliamentary seat. Along with the Nour, the Brotherhood had been particularly popular among young men in Upper Egypt. I sensed that this didnt reflect a deep faith in political Islam; instead, young people had grasped at any alternative to local traditions that forced them to do things like fetch chocolate bars for old men. Now that the Islamists had been decimated, the traditional system reasserted itself. In El-Balyana, the first round of voting, in mid-October, reduced the field to four finalists: Yusuf, Rafat, Mahmoud, and a former police brigadier named Nour Abu Steit. In tribal terms, the split was perfect: two Hawwara and two Arabs.

One of the eliminated candidates was Mahmoud Abu Mohasseb, a lawyer whom I had known for more than two years. In 2010, he had performed respectably in another local election, but this time he finished seventeenth out of nineteen. Afterward, he stopped picking up my calls. When I knocked on his apartment door, I heard his sons muffled voice: Daddys not coming.

In his village, close relatives also hadnt seen him. Others are mocking us, Khaled Abu Mohasseb, the candidates cousin, told me. These results are shameful. It doesnt suit the name of the family.

Khaled had helped his cousin campaign, but now he said that the candidacy had failed because of lack of effort. It seemed unfaireven months before the vote, I had seen him making home visits. But, when I asked Khaled if he felt sorry for his cousin, he shook his head. I feel more sorry for myself and for the family, he said.

In El-Balyana, it seemed very hard to lose gracefully. One bitter candidate told me that his family had engaged in fraud; another announced that he was moving to Cairo because of the stink of politics. Mohammed Abu Hilely, a prominent eliminated candidate from the Arab tribe, told me that Rafat and Mahmoudhis fellow-tribesmenhad paid off voters. Hilely posted a public statement on YouTube, calling upon the Arabs to support the two Hawwara candidates instead.

One evening, villagers in a coffee shop discussed Hilelys actions. Some believed that he had made his plea because his political career was finished, but Ahmed Diyab, a psychologist at the local elementary school, predicted that the final outcome would be a classic case of reverse psychology. By asking his tribesmen to support the Hawwara, Hilely had guaranteed that they would vote for the Arabs in even higher numbers.

Diyab claimed that being a psychologist who works with children helped him understand local political behavior. Maybe a kid is peeing on himself as a way of attracting attention, he said. Maybe I have a problem, but I cant express myself, so I use violence. After years of Cairo conversations, I found his analysis refreshing. In the capital, the lite often talk about the deep state, the military and financial interests that supposedly control everything. Others nurse conspiracy theories that connect the United States, Qatar, Israel, and the Muslim Brotherhood.

It felt simpler in a more isolated place, where one could recognize how social traditions contribute to political dysfunction. I suspected that Cairo isnt much different at its coreeven there, institutions are weak, and family hierarchies dominate most peoples lives. Officials respond to events in ways that feel more personal than political, and general patterns resemble those in El-Balyana, with all the conspiracy theories and the wild accusations of wrongdoing. Losers lash out, and anger is a common emotion, as is pride. The old control the young; the men control the women. But none of it can really be blamed on the Brotherhood, or the N.D.P., or any particular political figure. In Egypt, the family is the deep state.

Throughout the campaign, I never saw a candidate interact with a woman. During dozens of home visits, no one even asked after the health of the women who lived there. In southern villages, men sequester wives, daughters, and sisters; some elders told me that they forbade females from voting. When they did vote, they required special infrastructure. One advantage of wealth was that it allowed a candidate to hire vehicles to transport groups of women to polling stations. When I interviewed Nora Abdel Mohammed, who was one of the few women in her El-Balyana village with a government job, she told me that the revolution had done nothing to change gender relations. Women in the homes need somebody to reach them, she said, explaining that housewives from different families rarely meet with one another, because theres no female equivalent of the dawar.

In prominent families, dawar are impressive open-air courtyards, and only once did I hear a woman mentioned in this environment. The night before the runoff election, in late October, I visited the riverside dawar of Nour Abu Steit, the fourth finalist. He was a short, fierce-looking man who had recently retired from the police. He was Hawwara, and he began our conversation by claiming that the Abul Khair cousins had engaged in fraud. Such accusations were common, although nobody ever offered any evidence, and my impression was that the election was fair.

Nour asked about my nationality, and then he blamed the United States for El-Balyanas poverty. Weve had Egyptian sovereignty for seven thousand years, he said. You feel angry with us because of our civilization!

He sat with his back to the Nile, surrounded by two dozen elders. A ripple of laughter ran through the group. Nour told me that America had created Daesh, the Islamic State. I hope that God sends you earthquakes and volcanoes!

The men laughed again, and Nour told a story about a female American diplomat who supposedly had used sex to manipulate Saddam Hussein. In Egypt, I occasionally found myself in a situation where a man played to his companions by mocking the foreigner, and there was a bullying, locker-room dynamic. This quality seemed to characterize many of the worst aspects of Egyptian politicspride, shame, a refusal to compromise, periodic spasms of violenceand sometimes I wondered how much dysfunction could be attributed to the unrelenting maleness of power in Egypt. Many public figures seemed likely to benefit from even the occasional sound of a womans voice saying: Maybe you should stop talking now.

A woman with beautiful legs! Nour said. He was still describing the female diplomat. When Saddam talked to her, she took off her skirt, and she gave him the green light! The men laughed, and Nour ranted about Americans for a while. Finally, I asked if he opposed Egypts acceptance of the roughly one and a half billion dollars of annual aid from the United States.

That number is weak! he said. Its not suitable for Egypt.

I asked what a suitable figure might be.

Not less than eight billion dollars, he said proudly.

The most welcoming dawar belonged to Yusuf, who seemed like the only natural politician I met. Many Christians voted for himthey made up about ten per cent of the local population, but most candidates basically ignored them, because they were outside the tribal system. After the polls closed, I waited in Yusufs dawar, where elders tried to keep track of preliminary results. They did this by scribbling numbers chaotically onto scrap paperit struck me that a couple of computer-savvy kids could have figured out a system. But all the young supporters waited outside, holding big wooden staves. These are used in a traditional dance called the tahtib, which would be performed if the candidate won. Given the history of election fights in Upper Egypt, it seemed like a terrible idea to have mobs of young men holding sticks while waiting for the results.

All the candidates were at the election commissions headquarters, observing the count. Around midnight, somebody at Rafats dawar called to tell me that supporters were celebrating with gunfire. Soon after that, a young man burst into Yusufs headquarters and shouted, Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar! Everybody ran outside. Standing beside the door, I was joined by a cotton farmer in his sixties, who reached into his galabia, pulled out a 9-millimetre Helwan pistol, and fired four rounds into the sky. In the crowded street, men began waving sticks while others shot rifles and shotguns. A few minutes later, another mob appeared, holding sticks and guns and chanting Nour Abu Steits name. The same thing was happening at Mahmouds camp: in different corners of El-Balyana, the supporters of all four candidates claimed victory.

Al Hayah, a Cairo television station, announced that Yusuf and Nour were the winners, and the celebrations intensified. But soon there were rumors that the announcement was wrong, and then, at two oclock in the morning, an official statement finally came: the Abul Khair cousins had taken both seats.

At Yusufs dawar, one of the elders stormed into the street, furious about the premature celebration. Have you heard the real results? he shouted in a mocking tone. More than two hundred young men stood there, still clutching their sticks and guns.

The over-all winner was Mahmoud, and fewer than five hundred votes separated the other three candidates. Late that evening, I visited Mahmouds home, where the sound of ululating rang outon the upper floors, unseen women were celebrating.

In interviews, Mahmoud had always been guarded, and I often wondered what lessons his generation would take from the events of the past five years. Activists claim that young Egyptians now realize their power, having witnessed two Presidents being removed after protests. But it seems just as likely that this generation will conclude that such political activity changes nothing important. In Mahmouds dawar, I asked the former Salafi if there should be more space for political Islam, but he dodged the question. (We have new matters now.) His response was similar when I mentioned the Muslim Brotherhood. (I dont want to talk about old things.) He told me that he liked the current President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has led the crackdown against the Islamists. (Hes respectful.)

Nationwide, the biggest victor was a coalition called For the Love of Egypt, which swept all hundred and twenty list seats. It was led by a former Army general named Sameh Seif El-Yazal, who hoped to build a majority in the five-hundred-and-sixty-eight-member parliament. But the lack of strong parties insured a degree of chaos. In January, the parliament rejected a civil-service law that had been supported by Sisi, who wanted to reduce the bureaucracy. Clearly, this wasnt just a rubber-stamp parliament, but members were also unlikely to organize any kind of coherent opposition. In November, when I asked El-Yazal if he and Sisi had any significant differences of opinion, he said, So far, for seventeen months now, I havent seen a single mistake that hes made.

In front of Yusufs dawar, after the announcement, everybody stood in shock for a few minutes, and then the candidate appeared. You should go home, Yusuf said, gesturing to the mob of young men holding sticks. Its better than if a crime had happened.

A middle-aged man approached him, looking distraught. By God, did you have an accident? Yusuf said. He laughed and kissed the man on both cheeks. Go to sleep. Tomorrow well start a new life.

For ten minutes, he talked gently, until the street was clear. Then he took a seat at the back of the dawar. Once he was alone, his face transformedhe looked unspeakably sad. I sat nearby with my translator, and nobody said anything. All the elders had left; the room was silent. It was the emptiest dawar Id ever seen.

After a while, I said something about better luck next time.

Theres no next time, Yusuf said. Its ended for me, politically.

He said that he wanted to focus on farming for a while. Of the election, he said, It wasnt about services or love. If it had been, I would have won. He believed that the Abul Khair cousins had had an overwhelming financial advantage.

While we were talking, a young boy came and sat nearby, his eyes full of tears. Yusuf paused to comfort him on the way out, and I asked if he was one of his sons.

No, Yusuf said, and laughed lightly at thishis last act as a politician. He said, Ive never seen that boy before in my life. "
"117","Making the Tarot Literary Again.txt",525,1097,53,"In 1890, William Butler Yeats joined a recently founded magical fraternity called the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. For years he remained a dedicated member. (When the Golden Dawn split up, about a decade later, he joined a splinter group called the Stella Matutina.) The Golden Dawn took the ritual finery of Freemasonry and synthesized it with a kind of mystical Christianity, Jewish Kabbalah, and the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, an invented figure from late antiquity. The orders tools for attaining spiritual insight included ceremonial magic and tarot cards; the latter were particularly important to Yeats. His poetry is full of tarot imageryoften hidden, the scholar Kathleen Raine argued, as the secret society would have expected.

This is an aspect of Yeatss thinking that some readers find difficult to take seriously. Seamus Heaney, for instance, was dismissive of this occult side of Yeats work, as Christopher Benfey noted last year in The New York Review of Books. Heaney wasnt alone. Secular readers may forgive an artists Catholicism, say, because organized religion is serious and cultural, the writer and critic Jessa Crispin told me recentlybut the occult, she added, is just someone who spent too much time in their room alone and went to a weird place.

Crispin, who founded the popular literary blog Bookslut, in 2002, is now risking ridicule herself, with the publication of her second book, The Creative Tarot: A Modern Guide to an Inspired Life. The book is a manual intended to show that the tarot deck, primarily regarded as belonging to the domain of the esoteric, can be useful for anyone engaged in creative pursuits. Crispin said that, among her close friends and family, she is already known as a weirdo mystic but that publicly coming out of the spiritual closet may change how shes seen by those who know her only as a writer. N+1 is never going to hire me now, she joked.

Yeats is not the only respected writer to make use of the tarot: Italo Calvino, Salvador Dali, and even Charles Williams, a novelist and theologian who belonged to the Inklings literary circle, also drew on the cards. Still, the cards remain firmly associated with the occultand, while Crispin is sympathetic to that tradition, she aims to bring tarot to those who may be skeptical of that way of thinking. Her references are more literary than arcane. In this way, The Creative Tarot is not so different from her previous book, The Dead Ladies Project, an account of her journey through Europe and beyond in search of meaning in exile, via the lives of earlier writers and artists who also found themselves adrift.

Crispin presents her guide to the tarot deck alongside the stories of artists, writers, and musicians. At the end of her interpretation of each card, she offers a suggested list of supplemental material: poems, films, paintings. In the chapter on the Two of Cups, a card that, as Crispin explains, is about collaboration and mutual respect, she suggests the album My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, by Brian Eno and David Byrne, and the book Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie, by Lauren Redniss. The card shows a man and a woman each holding a cup; their cups touch, and from the union springs a winged-lion head atop a caduceus. Crispin emphasizes the decks archetypal imagery, as opposed to its purported divine power. Imagery lets us bypass the thinking process, she said. It gets to something more emotional and intuitive.

There are seventy-eight cards in a tarot deck: twenty-two trump cards (the Major Arcana), plus four suits (Minor Arcana), each with a set of ten pips and four face cards. The earliest known decks date to the fifteenth century and were used for games. The images on the cards began to incorporate alchemical symbols; eventually, the deck known as the Tarot de Marseille became standard, and people started using it for fortune-telling and divination. That version of the tarot inspired the Rider-Waite deck, designed by two members of the Golden Dawn, Arthur Waite and Pamela Colman Smith (Rider refers to the company that published the cards); their deck informed most subsequent versions. Waite saw magic not as a means to power but as a path toward a higher consciousness. He developed his tarot deck, Crispin writes, with an emphasis on symbolism and symbolisms connection to the intuition. Smith, who was introduced to the Golden Dawn by Yeats, worked with Waite to draw the pictures on the cards. In Crispins view, Smith is an uncelebrated illustrator, who took the original tarot imagery and refined it into something that really does resonate.

Crispin believes that the cards can help people get past their protective layers and toward greater self-understanding. She insists that using the cards is not the equivalent of therapy. When reading the tarot for someone, I tell a story, she said, and that person fits it into their own life. To do this requires going beyond the most basic interpretations. If all you rely on is one or two books about the tarot, she told me, the reading that results will be flat and predictable. For instance, in the instructions that come with a tarot deck, you might find the description of the Emperor card as authority and mastery of emotions. He is executive and realization, the power of this world, here clothed with the highest of its natural attributes, according to Waites The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, the book originally intended for use with his and Smiths deck. Crispin, on the other hand, turns to C. S. Lewiss The Chronicles of Narnia to illustrate the idea of mastery represented by the card. There are no wobbly to-and-fro plotlines in that multivolume saga, she writes. She contrasts it with the TV show Lost, which, she notes, was clearly made up as it went along.

Talking to Crispin, and reading her book, it is not always clear just what she sees as psychological and what, for her, has a metaphysical import. She insists that the meaning of the cards comes from us. But there is something transcendent at play for her when it comes to the tarot. She considers herself a religious person, and is intensely critical of the new atheism. She sees a renewed interest in tarot cards and other occult practices as a direct reaction to that kind of secular extremism. We are uncomfortable with our irrational selves, Crispin said. In her view, the irrational is something we need. And it is also, she added, where all the interesting work comes from."
"118","Man charged with more than two dozen felonies in string of violent crimes across L.A. County.txt",253,471,27,"Suspected of murder and robbery -- and said to be armed and dangerous by Los Angeles police -- Artyom Gasparyan ran his silver Volkswagen in the wrong direction down the 5 Freeway in Sun Valley in early January.

As he approached the Glenoaks Boulevard exit, the car crashed into another vehicle carrying a woman and children. The family suffered minor injuries and Gasparyan was taken to the hospital to be treated for his injuries.

There he stayed until last week, when he was finally booked into Los Angeles County jail. On Tuesday, prosecutors said he would be held to answer for a laundry list of crimes.

Between two separate cases, Gasparyan is charged with more than two dozen felonies: one count of murder, 12 counts of attempted murder, seven counts of second-degree robbery, two counts each of carjacking and fleeing police while driving recklessly, one count of felony hit-and-run and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon.

Prosecutors have not decided whether to seek the death penalty. Gasparyan was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday afternoon.

See more of our top stories on Facebook >>

Police said that Gasparyans string of crimes started Dec. 6 in northeast Los Angeles with a shooting, followed by another shooting in Burbank three days later. He was involved in an armed robbery four days after that and on Dec. 30, allegedly killed a man in Panorama City.

The hunt for Gasparyan intensified in January after a wild police chase, carjacking and standoff that began in Carson on New Years Day.

An off-duty officer noticed a Volkswagen driving erratically on the 105 Freeway and called the California Highway Patrol, the Los Angeles Police Department said. A police dispatcher told the officer that the vehicle was wanted in connection with a suspected car theft and robbery.

Patrol cars caught up to the car, which stopped near 223rd Street and Normandie Avenue. There, police said a passenger jumped out and carjacked a nearby Dodge Durango, firing four times at the driver. The shots missed, police said, but the man yanked the driver out of the SUV and took off.

The violent nature of the carjacking prompted police to follow the Durango instead of the other vehicle, police said. They chased the Durango into Long Beach, where it crashed on Wardlow Road near Maine Avenue.

The driver, later identified by police as Gasparyan's accomplice, Daniel Ramirez, jumped out of the vehicle and ran into a nearby home. Police said he shot and wounded two men inside and stabbed their father in the face before shooting himself in the head.

Ramirez eventually died from the injury.

"119","Mark Rylance Talks Poetry and Ice Fishing.txt",609,1581,105,"Zipped into an orange snowsuit, red puffer jacket, orange balaclava, and lace-up snow boots, the actor Mark Rylance was sweating a little during a technical rehearsal of Nice Fish, which opened last week at St. Anns Warehouse, in Brooklyn. He was trying to do two things at once: collapse a blue nylon tent in a high wind during a five-second stage blackout, and dodge huge snowballs that shot across the stage like bowling balls. Rylance, a man who offstage radiates an almost spectral equanimity, was mildly exasperated.

The director, Claire van Kampen, was standing alongside the stage. Lets practice it, she said. Van Kampen and Rylance have been married for twenty-seven years. Ill clap when theres a blackout.

Usually when theres a blackout, I come downstage with the snowballs, but you want me to stay and get the tent down? Rylance called from the stage. Which do you like better, Claire, my trying to avoid the snowballs or my being knocked down by them? He paused. I feel like Im in a home movie.

Nice Fish is about two old friends, Eric and Ron, who spend a day ice fishing on a lake in Minnesota. Rylance, formerly the director of the Globe Theatre, in London, has lived in England since his early twenties, but he grew up in Milwaukee, and he has retained an affinity for long winters and slow speech. During the past decade he has appeared frequently on the American stage and has won three Tony awards: for his portrayal of a hapless Midwestern visitor to a Paris bachelor pad, in the 2008 Broadway revival of Boeing-Boeing; for his 2011 role in Jerusalem, by Jez Butterworth, as an eccentric, phenomenally talkative layabout; and for playing the Countess Olivia, in Twelfth Night, in 2014.

Rylances acceptance speech at some of the award ceremonies baffled audiences. In 2008, his opening words were

When you are in town, wearing some kind of uniform is helpful, policeman, priest, etcetera. Driving a tank is very impressive, or a car with official lettering on the side. If that isnt to your taste, you could join the revolution, wear an armband, carry a homemade flag tied to a broom handle, or a placard bearing an incendiary slogan.

During the award broadcast, the camera panned to van Kampen, who could be seen laughing uproariously. The passage turned out to be a prose poem by the Minnesota poet Louis Jenkins, who is now seventy-three. His poems, which are syncopated reveries about bologna sandwiches, sea lions, and the meaning of life, are integral to the Nice Fish script.

Jenkins was baffled, too. He learned of Rylances interest in his poems when a friend called him to tell him about the speech. When Rylance later wrote to Jenkins and told him that hed like to turn his poems into a play, Jenkins said Rylance could go ahead, but he didnt know how hed do it. Jenkins, a large man with a white beard, played Old Man Winter in a production of Nice Fish in the ART Theatre, in Cambridge, in January, but he insists he knows nothing about theatre. At the opening of the plays Brooklyn run (in which he is not performing), he told me, This has been a surprising turn of events. But ice fishing, you know, to me, thats about the loneliness and single-mindedness of writing. You just sit there and hope for the best.

Rylance and van Kampen, in their first years together, founded the travelling acting troupe Phoebus Cart, and they were instrumental in the rebuilding of Shakespeares Globe, where she remains director of music. The last time that van Kampen directed Rylance was in the Globes first season, in 1997, in The Ghost of Lucrece, a play by the Restoration poet Thomas Middleton. I wasnt ready to direct, van Kampen told me. At the Globe, the benefit Ive had is working alongside many directors. Other people dont do that. After an apprenticeship, they fly solo. Ive had a chance to see many people at work. And Mark and I have co-directed.

Were not co-directing this! Rylance said. Im happy to leave it to Claire. And, at best, Im a player-director, but all the time I want to go out and hit the pitch. I dont have the experience of watching the play. Im a bit like a player in the fieldmy view, my interest, is developed as an actor.

Van Kampen countered, Your great benefit to the director is that you report from within the play how it feels.

Rylance shook his head. But the great director is someone who keeps track of the audience.

Nice Fish began with a foray on the ice. In the winter of 2008, Rylance played the title role in a production of Peer Gynt, at the Guthrie Theatre, in Minneapolis. There was an interval between performances, and a few friends invited him to go ice fishing. Van Kampen went too, but the wind knocked her over. In New York, a few months later, Rylance came across Jenkinss poems and recalled that day on the ice in Minnesota. I just liked the poems tremendously, he said. They made me laugh, but underneath there was a deep melancholy, a blue note that appealed to me.

During his dbut run on Broadway, Rylance and his stepdaughter Nataasha van Kampen wrote the poems on cards and taped them to the walls of the apartment where the family was staying. (Nataasha died in 2012, at the age of twenty-eight, of a giant berry aneurism. Nice Fish is dedicated to her.) We wanted to see how the poems talked to each other. Then we had a little read-through of what we had come up with, in New York, at Playwrights Horizon. By that time, I knew Louis, and he came to the reading, Rylance said. Nataasha made the sets; the snow was cotton wool, and she made small ice houses, a little like dollhouses. It was something to do, you know, with friends. We always had this idea of perspectivethere was always going to be a distant ice field. There the ice house came in on wheels.

Yes, van Kampen says. It just blew on.

The play is about how things can come to a crisis, Rylance explains. Its about cabin fever. I remember growing up in Milwaukee, and how, at a certain point, when the winter should have ended, you are trapped inside and you feel you must be outside.

Two summers ago, Rylance and van Kampen took a white-water-rafting trip down the Colorado River. Van Kampen said, We dont usually put ourselves in situations where we will be uncomfortable. I thought, I dont want to do this. But, by the end of the trip, I wanted to be first into the rapids, to be the person heading into the waves!

Rylance looked at her fondly, and said, You had been withdrawing.

Van Kampen replied, sternly, I hadnt pitched myself into the waves. In Nice Fish, those two men bring themselves forward into real risk. Why do people come to the theatre? Because they want to have a present human experience, with other people. She paused and looked at Rylance. We dont have boundaries. Its not as if Phyllida Lloyd or someone else is directing you. But we do have a massive amount of trust.

In the past decade, Rylance and van Kampen have worked together often; she arranged the music for the BBC-PBS television production of Wolf Hall, and composed the score for La Bte, Twelfth Night, and Richard III, all of which featured Rylance in lead roles.

Rylance nodded. We do trust each other. One day, on the Colorado River, we had a row. We were talking about rehearsing the playand the idea had been that, in rehearsal, I would be a kind of a sous-chef. I would prepare things for Claire to see. Wed tried that at the Guthrie, but then Claire came in saying, No, not right! 

Since the Colorado River, he said to van Kampen, youve gotten more in front of the boat.

Yes, now I like being in charge. I was a little quieter than you, a little flat-footed. I think I was in a shadow, and I wanted to be in a shadow. And no ones going to take you from the shadow and put you in the light. You have to do it.

Rylance agreed. For me, poetry is a lot about opening up a tight spot. My imagination will get claustrophobic, but if I turn to a poem I feel theres a lot of room to maneuver. Its not only claustrophobiait can be a feeling that I am in deep mud or shallow water, and Im catching only the surface of the deep blue.

As of a week ago, Rylance had won a BAFTA for his role as Rudolf Abel in the film Bridge of Spies (he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in that film on Sunday); he plays the giant in an upcoming film of Roald Dahls The BFG, directed by Steven Spielberg, which opens in July. In 2015, van Kampens first play, Farinelli and the King, about the eighteenth-century castrato and his relationship with the King of Spain, opened at the Globe, with Rylance in the lead role, then moved to the West End. It will open on Broadway in 2017. Are there more plans for Nice Fish?

Van Kampen laughed and said, It would be very exotic in England!"
"120","Meteor 'bright flash' seen in skies over Scotland.txt",382,930,52,"Media caption Ross Stewart was in a helicopter at the time and thought it was lightning

Footage has been recorded of a large meteor in the sky over north-east Scotland.

Police received a number of calls after a big, bright flash or 'fireball' was seen - with people reporting seeing a blue, white or green light.

Others said they had heard a rumbling sound.

Professor Keith Horne, from St Andrews University, said the meteor was probably about 10cm across, with the rumbling sound caused by a sonic boom.

The light appears to have been seen as far south as Berwickshire in the Scottish Borders and Newcastle at about 18:45 on Monday.

Garry J Hunter contacted BBC Scotland to say he had seen the flash over Lumphanan in Aberdeenshire. He described it as ""a huge fireball-like trail across the sky, which seemed to then explode and light up the whole sky"".

Media caption A bright flash and fireball seen in the night sky over north-east Scotland was probably a piece of space rock burning up in the atmosphere, an expert has said

The Met Office said the event was ""not weather-related"" as there were no thunder storms recorded on Monday night.

Professor Horne, who is from the university's School of Physics and Astronomy, said the flash would have been caused by a meteor travelling at about 30km per second.

""What you've seen is a piece of rock from outer space that has crashed into the earth,"" he said.

""When it hits the atmosphere it starts to burn up... It releases all this energy into the atmosphere which will cause a bright flash and sometimes bits of this explode.""

The professor told BBC Radio Scotland's John Beattie programme that most meteors were just a speck of dust - causing commonly seen ""shooting stars"" - but this one would have been about 10cm (4in) across.

He said it probably burnt up at an altitude of 20 miles (32km) without any pieces reaching Earth.

Driving instructor Bill Addison, from Buckie in Moray, recorded the sight on his dashboard camera.

Mike Fleming captured similar footage on the road between Dunecht and Castle Fraser in Aberdeenshire.

'Scary and amazing'

The ""flash"" was also caught on a security camera at Woodend, Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire, which was sent in by Craig Lindsay.

Jenni Morrison captured dashcam footage of the flash as she drove on the A944 between Westhill in Aberdeenshire at about 18:45.

She said: ""it was the most surreal thing I have ever experienced"".

Media caption A bright flash seen in the skies over Scotland on Monday evening is caught on camera by Jenni Morrison from Aberdeenshire

She told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""It was pitch black and then all of a sudden it was like a light switch went on. It became daylight - the whole sky lit up.

""I looked at my son, he looked at me and then it just went black again. It really didn't last long at all - literally seconds.

""We didn't realise what it was at the time until we looked back on my dashcam. We saw the ball of light over the trees on the left side coming down at some speed and then a massive flash.

""It was scary and amazing at the same time.""

Val Hamilton from Nethy Bridge said she saw the sky light up south west of Aviemore at about 18:45.

""I saw a white ball with a tail passing through the sky at great speed. It was very dramatic,"" she said.

Heather Mullan, from Aberdeenshire, said: ""The sky seemed to slowly brighten then there was a double flash of intense light then nothing.

""About 90 seconds later there was a double muffled sound like a sonic boom. We assumed we had just witnessed a meteor although no meteor showers are due. It was spectacular.""

The Reverend Helen Savage told BBC Scotland: ""I was driving across the Durham Moors from Rookhope to Hunstanworth at that time and was surprised to see what I thought to be lightning - to the north.

""When I got home 20 minutes later I checked Rainfall radar - I didn't think thunder storms had been forecast - and found nothing recorded.""

Phil Hoyle was leaving the Balmedie Country Park, near Aberdeen, when he heard a ""humming noise"" over the sea.

He said: ""When I looked I could see this light moving quickly with a small white tail, but it stopped over the sea and had a shape to it.""

Julian Bell, from Dollar, in Clackmannanshire was driving over the Clackmannan bridge.

He said: ""I thought at first it was a firework but it was too bright and white and instant and covered too much area for a firework.

""I then thought it was thunder and lightning but didn't hear anything and there was only one flash and no rain.""

Ross Stewart told BBC Scotland he was returning from offshore and was on a helicopter back to Aberdeen at the time.

He said: ""I noticed a few small clouds that seemed to be glowing slightly, then the whole sky above the chopper lit up followed by a series of flashes. I thought we were going to be hit by lightning.""

"121","Migrant crisis_ UN says Europe is 'on cusp of self-induced crisis'.txt",357,737,37,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Health workers say they are increasingly concerned about the situation at the Idomeni camp

Europe is ""on the cusp of a largely self-induced humanitarian crisis"" because of a rapid build-up of migrants on Greece's borders, the UN has warned.

""The crowded conditions are leading to shortages of food, shelter, water and sanitation,"" UN refugee agency (UNHCR) spokesman Adrian Edwards said.

Close to 24,000 migrants in Greece are in need of housing.

Some 8,500 of them are stuck in worsening conditions on the Greece-Macedonia border.

The crossing at Idomeni is now closed following protests by migrants desperate to continue their journey to Western European countries. Some migrants have been stranded at the overburdened camp for more than a week.

""At least 1,500 had spent the previous night in the open,"" Mr Edwards said on Tuesday.

""Tensions have been building, fuelling violence and playing into the hands of people smugglers,"" the spokesman added.

The site was beset by heavy rain overnight, posing serious health risks to a minority with no shelter.

BBC reporters saw hundreds more migrants heading across fields towards Idomeni on Tuesday.

Hundreds of small tents have been erected in the fields around the official camp, which can take no more people. Families of 10 are sharing four-man tents, Caroline Haga, an emergency co-ordinator for the International Red Cross (ICRC), told the BBC.

Ms Haga, who left the camp on Monday night but is due to return on Tuesday, said the medical charity had serious concerns for the health of the migrants as the weather deteriorated.

""Many people here are soaking wet and cold from having to sleep out in the open, it still dips below 10 here during the night,"" she said.

""We are already seeing a lot of flu cases, especially among children, so imagine if they have to sleep outside in the wet again. It could turn into a very serious health problem.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption More than 7,000 people are stranded at the Idomeni camp, which was designed for 1,500

A medical station set up by the ICRC and Hungarian Red Cross was struggling to provide care for the large number of unwell and the pregnant, Ms Haga said, including people suffering from respiratory illnesses including bronchitis.

To make matters worse, a significant number of people were refusing to be taken away from the site for emergency care for fear of losing their place in the queue.

On Monday, a man suffering an epileptic fit refused to be moved, Ms Haga said.

Hassan Rasheed, 27, from Iraq, told the Associated Press: ""I've been at Idomeni for 10 days, and it's the fourth day I've been waiting to cross over.

Media caption Growing numbers of refugees and migrants are arriving on the Greek side of the border with Macedonia

""Conditions are very bad. There are many ill children who are coughing, and we spent the night in this tent under heavy rain.""

Ahmed Majid, a 26-year-old Iraqi travelling with his wife and two children, said: ""We have been walking for three kilometres. Police stopped our taxi on the national road, which is why we are going through the fields.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Thousands of migrants are en route to Idomeni, despite the border closure

Macedonia was sporadically allowing few hundred people through the crossing, mostly Syrians and Iraqis, which was relieving pressure on the camp.

But last week it began refusing entry to Afghan migrants and imposing stricter document controls on Syrians and Iraqis, slowing the passage to a trickle.

Then on Monday Macedonia firmly closed the wire-mesh gate that separates it from the camp, citing the closure by Serbia of its northern border. A similar domino effect has been seen repeatedly over the past few months as Eastern European countries attempt to reduce the number of migrants within their borders.

Frustration at the closure boiled over on Monday and scores of migrants clashed with security guards. Some attempted to smash through a fence, prompting the guards to fire tear gas and rubber bullets.

Thousands of migrants and refugees are en route to Idomeni, despite the border closure. With the camp overwhelmed, many have been forced to wait on buses and at petrol stations along the route from Athens.

The Greek military has established three other border camps nearby to Idomeni, Ms Haga says, but all are already full, with about 2,000 people at each."

So says a new list put out by proofreading app Grammarly, whose team ranked the biggest names on Twitter by grammatical correctness. In a report released today (Mar. 1), analysts reviewed 150 tweets from each of the 50 most followed accounts (according to Twitter Counter), searching for unintended misspelled words, incorrect or missing punctuation, and violations of subject-verb agreement.

Human proofreaders then reviewed the offenses culled by the app, leaving out uses of slang, acronyms, and missing punctuation at the end of a tweet. Grammarly marketing analyst Michael Mager tells Quartz the ranking is meant as a hat-tip to celebrities with exemplary writing skills.

US president Barack Obama, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, and philanthropist Bill Gates cluster toward the top of the list, as do talk show hosts OBrien and Ellen Degeneres, and pop musician Shakira. When all is said and done, though, a tweeters grammar skills seem to have little or no bearing on his or her popularity: Pop stars Katy Perry and Justin Bieber, with two of the biggest followings, are clustered in the middle of the list at 26 and 19, respectively. Lady Gaga, with the 6th biggest following, is ranked close to the bottom."
"123","Money isn't talking  a third of GOP individual donations in Super Tuesday states went to candidates who quit.txt",174,262,19,"As the polls open across the 13 Super Tuesday states holding primaries or caucuses, many voters wont find the name of their preferred Republican candidate. Individual donors in Super Tuesday states spent approximately $71 million giving to Republican candidate principal campaign committees, their (official) supporting committees and (unofficially) affiliated super PACs since the start of the election season in November 2014. Of that number, $23.55 million nearly a thirdwent to candidates who have already dropped out of the race.

Those statistics would be even more skewed were it not for the $29 million raised by Sen. Ted Cruz from his home state of Texas.

Perhaps more astounding, Republican front-runner Donald Trump raised only a minuscule $812,000 from Super Tuesday state donors  the second least of any candidate. Only Jim Gilmore, who received 12 votes in the Iowa caucuses, failed to raise more.

Democrats, meanwhile, raised $29.8 million in these states from individual donors. Of that number, however, only $876,000 didnt find its way to Hillary Clinton or Sen. Bernie Sanders.

In an electoral process where money usually talks, individual donations seem to have had little bearing on the campaign results thus far.

"124","More than a third of people shot by L.A. police last year were mentally ill, LAPD report finds.txt",436,1052,55,"More than a third of the people shot by Los Angeles police last year had documented signs of mental illness, nearly triple the number from the year before, according to a lengthy review by LAPD officials made public Tuesday.

The report also found that African Americans continued to account for a disproportionately high number of people shot by officers, given the city's demographics. Eight of the 38 people  or 21%  struck by LAPD gunfire in 2015 were black, the report said. African Americans make up about 9% of the city's population.

The sweeping 300-page analysis  an effort designed to help identify ways to reduce use-of-force incidents  offered an in-depth look at how and when Los Angeles police officers used force in recent years.

But the numbers also offered a stark reminder of questions that have plagued the LAPD and agencies across the country: How can officers safely interact with a growing mentally ill population? And how can departments heal strained relationships with black residents when police shootings of African Americans remain disproportionately high?

LAPD Chief Charlie Beck told his civilian bosses Tuesday that the report would offer a framework for the Police Commission, the department and the public to talk about how Los Angeles police use force.

He and other top brass stressed that although encounters in which officers use force were relatively rare  accounting for fewer than 2,000 of the 1.5 million contacts officers made last year  the department was eager to drive the number down.

We're more than willing to look ourselves in the mirror and say, What's occurring and how can we do better?' Beck said.

A handful of last year's shootings generated questions and criticism that continue to linger. Two of the most high-profile incidents  one on skid row, the other near the Venice boardwalk  involved officers killing black men who were homeless.

On Tuesday, activists packed the commission meeting to mark the one-year anniversary of the skid row shooting, in which officers fatally shot Charly Africa Keunang after, police say, he grabbed a rookie cop's holstered gun. Keunang had previously spent years in a prison mental hospital.

As Beck began to speak to the commissioners, activists leaped from their seats, holding signs with Keunang's name. Can't kill Africa! they chanted.

Other agencies have been pushing for reforms in how the criminal justice system treats mentally ill offenders, whose numbers are increasing in jails and courtrooms. Federal authorities are pressuring county supervisors to improve jail conditions for mentally ill inmates. L.A. County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey is looking at ways to divert mentally ill people from the criminal justice system.

Fourteen of the 38 people shot by LAPD officers in 2015 had documented signs of mental illness, the LAPD's report said. And about a quarter of the nearly 1,900 less-serious uses of force  which range from an officer using a Taser or firing a bean-bag shotgun to grabbing someone  involved someone the officer believed was mentally ill.

Beck said the department was also looking at how officers could best interact with someone believed to be mentally ill and under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The chief also noted an increase in shootings involving people investigators later determined may have been trying to commit suicide by cop.

Brittney Weissman, an executive director with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said the sharp uptick in shootings of mentally ill people raises a lot of questions for us. She called for more de-escalation training for officers along with diversionary programs for mentally ill people who are arrested.

Number of officer-involved-shootings where person shot had a documented sign of mental illness. Number of officer-involved-shootings where person shot had a documented sign of mental illness. Number of officer-involved-shootings where person shot had a documented sign of mental illness.

I do think that every law enforcement agency has room for improvement in dealing with people with mental illness and the homeless, and the LAPD is no exception, Weissman said.

LAPD officials noted the department has already made some changes reflecting the trends described in the report, including last year's rollout of so-called de-escalation training focused on slowing down volatile situations, particularly those involving people who may be mentally ill.

The department is also making less-lethal devices  the use of which increased last year  more readily available to officers. Officers are also now required to carry Tasers, and soon will keep bean-bag shotguns in the front of their patrol cars instead of the trunk.

Another area of the report that prompted questions from experts and police commissioners was the number of African Americans shot by police last year.

Black residents, department officials said, are also over-represented among violent crime victims. The report said African Americans also made up 41% of violent crime suspects in 2015, 33% of violent crime arrestees and 26% of people stopped by police.

LAPD officials said it was important to understand that the over-representation of African Americans in the criminal justice system was not limited to police shootings. Still, Capt. John McMahon told commissioners that this department won't rest until we get that number to zero. That's the only number that is acceptable to us.

Total number of people shot by LAPD officers 2011-2015

Peter Bibring, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, said he was troubled by the numbers.

It's not surprising that if the LAPD is disproportionately stopping and searching African Americans that they are also disproportionately using force, including deadly force, Bibring said. This is a point that we've been trying to make for a long time.

Twenty-two  or 58%  of the 38 people shot by LAPD officers in 2015 were Latino, the report found. Latinos make up 48% of the city's population.

The report also noted a sharp jump in the number of in-custody deaths, which rose to a dozen in 2015 compared with four the year before. Police said at least half of those incidents involved someone who, according to toxicology tests, was under the influence of drugs.

Police commissioners welcomed the analysis, saying it offered valuable data that could be used to identify trends that could be addressed in training and tactics.

Police Commissioner Robert Saltzman said the report was among the most important he had seen during his nine-year tenure.

Few of the excesses of the group that calls itself Islamic State have transfixed the outside world as much as its destruction of Palmyra, the ancient desert oasis city in central Syria. Palmyra's remarkable 2,000-year-old Temple of Bel was demolished in August 2015.

It looked in many ways like a great Greek temple. Standing in the middle of a walled sanctuary, the rectangular structure had once been ringed by towering 15m-high columns - Corinthian columns, topped by carvings of acanthus leaves. Some of these still stood, two millennia later, before IS blasted the temple to bits.

There were differences from the familiar Greek design, though. The roof had been decorated with stone triangles, or merlons, that ran along its edges like rows of giant, pointy teeth. And the entrance wasn't quite where you might have expected it to be. In most classical temples the door is on the short side of the rectangle and leads to a single altar, but in Palmyra the main entrance was on the long side.

""Inside you have to turn either right or left because the temple had two altars,"" says Nasser Rabbat, a Syrian art historian who in the 1970s lived for a while in a house inside the temple compound. ""There are multiple gods that are being worshipped in there.""

Two thousand years ago, Palmyra was a key oasis on a desert trade route that linked the Mediterranean world with lands to the south and east. It grew rich from this trade, and was strongly influenced by its trading neighbours.

The culture that developed was ""Arab in origin but then classical in influence and in temperament and inclination"" according to Rabbat, who likens Palmyra to Petra in Jordan. Both, he says, are ""a mark of how cultures can come together creatively"".

One detail of the temple Rabbat points to as a good example of this mingling of cultures is a frieze showing a funeral procession.

""There are three women carved in a very abstract way, as if they are clad in togas but they are wrapped from the head all the way to the bottom. They're dressed like a classical woman, but these are Arab desert-based women and their heads are covered,"" he says.

""The artist has done it with flowing lines that are extremely sinuous... What you see is something that is very geometric, but immediately evocative of the image of a bunch of women walking together.""

In later years, as Christianity spread across the region, the temple became a Byzantine Church, and then with the coming of Islam, a mosque.

By the early 1900s, Palmyra had been a ruin for centuries, but parts of it were still inhabited. Some old buildings were used as shelters by herders and nomads, while the compound of the Temple of Bel had become a small village.

""People were integrated in this fabric of inhabited heritage,"" says the Syrian archaeologist Salam al-Kuntar from the University of Pennsylvania Museum.

""I have a special love for Palmyra because the Temple of Bel is where my mother was born.

""My grandfather was a policeman serving in Palmyra and my grandmother wasn't even 20 years old when she got married and moved to Palmyra. The Palmyrene women taught her how to make bread and cook. I hear many stories about the building, how people used the space, how children played around, including my mum. So that's what it means to me. This is the meaning of heritage - it's not only architecture or artefacts that are representing history, it's these memories and ancestral connection to the place.""

When IS destroyed the temple in August last year the main entrance arch remained standing - the only part that survived.

Zenobia's story

Another illustration of Salam al-Kuntar's point about heritage being bound up in memories and lived experience, is the story of Zenobia al-Asaad, whose father, the archaeologist Khaled al-Asaad, was head of antiquities at Palmyra for 40 years.

When Zenobia was born, her parents named her after the Palmyrene queen who led a rebellion in the 3rd Century AD against the city's Roman overlords, and carved an empire that stretched from modern day Turkey to Egypt.

""My dad wanted to give me and my sisters the names of special Arab women characters - especially those that he admired. One of my sisters is called Fairouz, after the Lebanese singer. But I like to think that Zenobia was the most special for him!"" says Zenobia.

""So, yes I'm really proud of my name, very proud. Even when I was at school I remember feeling almost sorry for my friends that I've got this lovely name while they all had their normal names! But really, what makes me most proud is that my name was chosen by my father. And my name will always make me think of him.

""When I was a little girl, I remember sitting in the car with him, driving from our home in the modern part of Palmyra over to the ancient sites. We would walk around together, checking on things, laughing, talking, and the way he talked about Palmyra made me love the city even more, because I know he loved it. He would explain what some of these things once were - this was a temple, this was a tomb, this city was the place where Zenobia was from, who I'm named after.""

Khaled al-Asaad had devoted his life to the study of the city, from its Roman-era tombs to the Temple of Bel. He and his daughter were both living there when IS - known as Daesh in Arabic - arrived in 2015. While many fled, he chose to stay.

""The day Daesh came to Palmyra feels like a blur, a dream, or nightmare. I remember being at home and I saw my neighbours and people, just running, the streets were in chaos. And they said, 'Daesh are coming to Palmyra they're barely a few miles away.'"" Zenobia says.

""I told my father who was in his own house, 'You have to move, you have to leave with us,' and he said, 'No I don't want to leave, I was born in this city and I will die in this city.'""

During the chaos, Zenobia's husband Khalil Hariri and her brother Mohammed - also archaeologists - managed to load about 400 antiquities on to trucks. As they were leaving, they came under heavy gunfire from approaching IS fighters, which prevented Zenobia and her 15-year-old son from jumping on board.

Media caption Jeremy Bowen speaks to two of Syria's ""Monuments Men""

She fled on foot with her son. However, with nowhere to go and armed with only her ID card, she soon returned.

""I went to my house and this Daesh [IS] fighter opened my own front door and refused to let me in. Around 10 other men turned up. I thought I was about to faint but my neighbours were with me, they were supporting me. I told the Daesh men, this is my house, can you at least let me get my wallet. They said, 'We can only give you your wallet if your husband will come and pick it up.' My husband wasn't there and so my son and I were homeless.

""But I wasn't scared and I was determined to get my house back. This was my home, how dare they take it! So in the morning I would go to my house and sit on the pavement in front and look at it, just watch them inside my house, walking in and out with their guns, like it was just a hotel for them.

""There were maybe 40 Daesh fighters inside my house. I would knock on the front door and ask for my things but there was always an excuse. 'We don't know where the Emir is,' or, 'The Emir is sleeping, we have to wait until he wakes up.' Under the new Daesh rules, women couldn't walk by themselves so my son went everywhere with me.

Image copyright Rubina Raja, Palmyra Portrait Project Image caption The so-called ""Beauty of Palmyra"" bust was discovered during excavations in Palmyra, by Danish archaeologist H Ingholt, in the 1920s

""Being in Palmyra during that time was just horrible. When Daesh would kill someone, they would leave their corpse rotting in the street for three days so everyone could see. And I would wonder who this person was and who their family was and if they had to walk down this street too.

""The only person able to console me was my father. I was crying, and I remember my father telling me in his gentle voice, 'Don't worry, as long as you are fine, as long as your son is fine, this is the most important thing. Houses come and go, money comes and goes. It doesn't matter. Family is what matters.'""

After a few weeks, Zenobia and her son managed to leave Palmyra and join the rest of her family, but her father stayed.

""He told me to take care of my children. And I remember him saying that if I ever needed anything that he'll always be there. He told me to stay strong for my family's sake. He told me 'I need Zenobia back, Zenobia the strong one, the one that I know.' And these were his last words to me.""

Khaled al-Asaad was eventually arrested by IS.

""Those days were just awful. Every time the phone rang I wanted it to be him, or my brother saying, 'It's OK, our father is fine, he's free.' I can't describe this feeling, like hope and despair all mixed up in my heart. Then on the 28th day my brother came, and he was crying and all he said was, 'He's gone.' He didn't go into details and he didn't tell us how our father had died.""

IS fighters executed Khaled al-Asaad in public in August. They hung a placard around his body accusing of him being an ""apostate,"" a ""director of idolatry"" guilty of attending ""infidel"" academic conferences.

""And then all I wanted to know were his last words. What did he say, what did Daesh say to him, did they insult him? What we later heard was that my father - true to character - was calm, and his last wish was to see the city. Then they brought him back to kill him. Apparently he read the Koran quite loudly, and he was smiling, and this upset Daesh, they didn't like that and when they told him to kneel, he refused.

""I can't explain why I wanted to know these details, I just wanted to know what he went through. I remembered those unknown dead, beheaded people I saw on the streets of Palmyra, thinking, 'Oh my God, what happened to this person, I feel for their family.' And imagine, now this had happened to my own father. He was beheaded and his body was left outside for everyone to see. We don't even know where his remains are.

""The person most affected is my mother of course - but she tries to be strong. We don't want to feel weak, but I cannot really deny it, life is not easy. There's no peace inside me, but whenever I cry, I remember my father, I see him in front of me and his image is what gives me hope. He taught us to be strong and this is what I always want to remember.

""Believe it or not, I can't stop thinking about him, everything about him, his laugh, he had a really kind heart and playfulness, just like a small child. I think a lot about his touch, his hands, I imagine him sitting at home at the dining table. Whatever I tell you now I won't be really saying everything I think about him, because I can't explain my feelings, there's just too much. I remember his white hair, his eyes, and as I tell you about these things I can feel there is fire inside my heart. My heart is too full.""

Now in Damascus with her mother and husband, Zenobia does not want to return to Palmyra. The destruction of its old stone monuments is forever linked with the death of her father.

""Palmyra the ancient city will always be a part of me, but I can't really imagine going back to Palmyra walking along the paths, looking at the sites without my father, he's the one who made us love this place.

""Just like the palm trees in Palmyra, where they really stand strong, rooted in the city, my father will be the same, he will be like these palm trees in Palmyra, rooted in the grounds of the city, always connected to the city and to us.""

"126","Museum of Lost Objects_ The Winged Bull of Nineveh.txt",586,1424,75,"One year ago a man took a pneumatic drill to the statue of a winged bull at the gates of the ancient city of Nineveh, near Mosul in modern Iraq. It's one of countless treasures destroyed by vandals, militants or military action in the region in the past 15 years. This is the first of 10 stories about ancient objects that have now been lost.

The winged bull had the head of a man, the wings of an eagle, and the hulking body of a bull. Known as a Lamassu, other examples had the body of a lion. It was a composite of the most powerful and ferocious creatures known in the region, and this particular sculpture was huge - about 4.5m high, and up to 30 tonnes in weight.

It stood at one of the many gates along Nineveh's city walls, as a protective spirit and a symbol of the power of the Assyrian king.

Image copyright Alamy Image caption The Lamassu on the right of the Nergal Gate, photographed in 1977

""They're very intimidating. Those faces look quite daunting, the wings, the hooves, and the combined creature of many different animals that's very large and menacing-looking. It does strike you a little bit with fear which I suppose is part of the reason for these things,"" says Mark Altaweel, an Iraqi-American archaeologist.

At the same time, amid its mass of curly hair and its tumbling beard, the Lamassu does have a kind of tight-lipped smile. It is stern, but in its own way welcoming.

It was hewn from a single slab of limestone about 2,700 years ago, in the reign of the Assyrian King Sennacherib, ruler of an empire covering parts of modern Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.

Nineveh, Sennacherib's capital ""would have been the city of cities"", says Altaweel. ""The largest city anywhere on Earth, probably, by the time it reaches its peak in the 7th Century BC. All roads would have literally led to Nineveh.""

Image copyright Alamy Image caption Sennacherib's palace in Nineveh - as imagined by a Victorian artist

But a few generations after Sennacherib's death, Assyria was overrun. Nineveh was sacked and its palaces, walls and Lamassus slowly sank beneath the ground, eventually becoming a series of mounds of dust, sand and earth.

The name of Nineveh lived on partly thanks to its role in the Old Testament and the Koran, and in the 19th Century French and British explorers were inspired by Biblical texts to seek out the famed city.

When the winged bulls emerged again from the dirt, the man who led the excavation, Sir Austen Henry Layard, was struck by their majesty and the exquisite craftsmanship.

Image caption A Lamassu sculpture photographed in 1906 at Nimrud, near Nineveh

""Wide spreading wings rose above their backs, and their breasts and bodies were profusely adorned with curled hair,"" he wrote in 1853.

""Behind them were colossal winged figures of the same height, bearing the pine cone and basket. Their faces were in full, and the relief was high and bold. More knowledge of art was shown in the outline of the limbs and in the delineation of the muscles than in any sculpture I have seen of this period. The naked leg and foot were designed with a spirit and truthfulness worthy of a Greek artist.""

Layard shipped Lamassus from Nineveh and other excavated Assyrian cities back to London, where some stand today in the British Museum. There are others in Paris, New York, Chicago and Baghdad.

As modern Mosul developed and grew, the city began to encroach on Nineveh's archaeological sites and gobble them up. There's a story of an Iraqi archaeologist lying down in front of a bulldozer in a vain attempt to stop its advance.

""Most of the site was essentially still [an archaeological] site but some of it was occupied by modern housing developments,"" says Mark Altaweel.

""So I should say that the Iraqi government was relatively good, even during the Ba'ath regime in terms of trying to protect archaeological sites. They recognised that these things were important for national identity and for tourism and other kinds of benefits as well.

""But particularly after 2003, law and order has broken down, frankly, in Iraq. Since then we're seeing people building on the site willy-nilly, without actually paying attention to the rules that were in place.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lamassus in the Assyrian hall at the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad

But the greatest damage has been done in the last two years. When IS turned up, the skyline of Mosul changed forever with the detonation of shrines, minarets, mosques. And in time they turned their attention to Nineveh, and the winged bull, blasting away its face with a drill.

""Really I find it the most iconic of what ISIS destroyed, is going and boring the eyes of the Bull,"" says Lamia al-Gailani, a leading Iraqi archaeologist.

According to al-Gailani, this violent action can be traced back to the ancient world. When cities were sacked, marauding armies engaged in ritualised vandalism. This would involve smashing images of the king on the reliefs along palace walls. You hadn't fully toppled a king till you had also annihilated his images.

In Nineveh not only did IS gouge out the eyes of the Lamassu, they also blew up the shrine of the Prophet Jonah - Nabi Younis - who lived in Nineveh after his entanglement with the whale.

There's a photo of Nabi Younis taken in the 1980s, and it shows a road, heavy with traffic, snaking between the tall piles of earth on the excavation site. It has always been difficult to separate everyday human life from the ancient monuments.

This was also true 3,000 years ago. What Lamia al-Gailani remembers most fondly about the Lamassu wasn't its eyes or the ringlets of its beard, but something easy to miss.

At the base of the statue, she found faint lines scratched by generations of ancient soldiers. These guards of the Assyrian empire, when they weren't off campaigning, had to keep themselves occupied on sentry duty, and entertained themselves with a game using a board they carved into the plinth of the august Lamassu. And according to al-Gailani, it looks like a game the people of Mosul still play today, called dana.

It can be so easy to imagine these monuments as power frozen in stone. But in the case of the Lamassu, we remember its stony magnificence, but we also remember those Assyrian guards, who refused to be awed and carried on playing.

When Hormuzd Rassam was growing up, Mosul was a peaceful place. The city was part of the slowly dying Ottoman Empire, a provincial backwater that offered few prospects for a young man of energy and talent. But in 1845, when Rassam was 19 years old, he met someone who changed the trajectory of his life - Austen Henry Layard.

Layard was an adventurer who had arrived in the Middle East on horseback at the end of the 1830s, armed with plenty of cash and a pair of revolvers. He was captivated by the ruins of Iraq.

"127","My kids are worth how much_.txt",481,1343,94,"Most parents wouldnt trade the experience of raising children for anything in the world.

If only it werent so darn expensive. Between the medical bills, child care and college tuition, its a wonder parenting hasnt gone the way of the wet nurse. Fortunately, the government offers some generous tax breaks to help ease the financial burden. Its up to taxpayers, of course, to take full advantage of them  and in some cases this can be difficult, since it may involve figuring out which breaks are more beneficial than others.

There are a few things parents should understand. First, most child-related deductions and credits are available whether families take the standard deduction or itemize deductions. Second, theres a difference between deductions and the more coveted tax credits. Dont confuse the two. A deduction, such as the college tuition and fees deduction, merely decreases taxable income. A tax credit, such as the child-tax credit, allows taxpayers to subtract the amount dollar for dollar from their tax bill, or add the amount to their refund.

The most generous tax breaks come with income limits. The tax credits in particular are geared more for middle- and lower-income families. If you dont qualify for a credit or deduction, you can still save money by setting aside pretax dollars in flexible-spending accounts for medical and child-care expenses.

Heres a brief summary of the most common tax breaks available for parents. Some of the rules can be complicated, to say the least; when in doubt, consult a tax adviser.

Deductions

Exemptions. Lets start with the basics. Every member of a household potentially counts toward a tax-deductible exemption on the family tax return. For 2016, each exemption equates to a $4,050 deduction. So a married couple with two kids qualifies for four exemptions totaling $16,200 in tax-saving deductions. That is significant!

Tuition and fees. Helping a child pay for college? Uncle Sam will cut you some slack. In 2016, parents can deduct up to $4,000 in tuition expenses and mandatory enrollment fees provided their modified AGI doesnt exceed $130,000 for married couples or $65,000 for single parents. That deduction gets cut in half to $2,000 for married couples making between $130,000 and $160,000, and for single parents earning between $65,000 and $80,000. The deduction is wiped out entirely for those with higher modified AGIs. Parents should also note that the college tuition and fees deduction cant be used in conjunction with the higher-education credits, which we will discuss later. Note that this tax break expired at the end of 2014, but it was resurrected for 2015 and 2016 by legislation enacted in late 2015.

Student-loan interest. Even if parents set aside money for their childs college tuition, chances are theyll still need to borrow money. Thankfully, a portion of qualifying student-loan interest (loans from family, for example, dont count) is also tax deductible. The IRS allows parents to write off up to a maximum of $2,500 in loan interest. For 2016, this deduction phases out for married filers with modified AGIs between $130,000 and $160,000 and for single filers between $65,000 and $80,000. The only rule here is that students must be enrolled at least part time in a degree program to qualify. For more on student loans, see our story .

Could you pass sixth grade Econ? (4:55) More middle schools are adding economics to the curriculum, teaching concepts like ""scarcity"" and ""demand.""

Tax credits

Child-tax credit. In a parents eye, a child is priceless. However, Uncle Sam puts the figure at $1,000, in the form of a tax credit. And unlike some other credits and deductions, the government doesnt limit how many children qualify. So if you have four little darlings under the age of 17, expect to get $4,000 wiped off your tax bill.

Like most credits, this one also has income restrictions, but they vary depending on how many children parents are claiming. The child-tax credit starts to phase out at modified AGIs that exceed $110,000 for married couples filing together, $55,000 for married filing separately and $75,000 for single parents.

Child and dependent care credit. Two-income households with children under 13 years old qualify for a dependent-care credit to help cover child-care expenses. The IRS allows working parents and those looking for a job (students and disabled parents also qualify) a credit of 20% to 35% on expenses up to $3,000 in child care for one kid and $6,000 for two or more kids. This translates into a maximum credit of $1,050 for one child and $2,100 for two or more kids.

The credit for parents earning more than $43,000 shrinks to just $600 for one child and $1,200 for two or more kids. Higher-income taxpayers should set aside pretax dollars in an employers flexible spending account instead. Well talk more about these later.

American Opportunity higher-education credit. There are two higher-education education credits. The American Opportunity credit is to help pay for an undergraduate college education. It is worth up to $2,500 per student per year. To qualify, the student must be in his or her first four years of college. (There is no limit on the number of children who can qualify in any given year.) This credit phases out for married joint filers with modified AGIs between $160,000 and $180,000, and $80,000 and $90,000 for single parents.

Lifetime Learning higher-education credit. The Lifetime Learning credit is less restrictive than the American Opportunity credit. It covers students who have piled up more than four years of college credit and any other family members taking classes. Heres the hitch: It can be claimed only once on any given tax return. Some families, however, will be able to claim the American Opportunity credit for one student and the Lifetime Learning credit for another. The latter is worth 20% of tuition and other qualified expenses of up to $10,000, for a maximum credit of $2,000. For 2016, the Lifetime Learning credit is phased out for married joint filers with modified AGIs between $111,000 and $131,000, and $55,000 to $65,000 for single parents.

Adoption credit. No one said adopting a child would be easy or inexpensive. Theres the waiting game, the agency interviews and the lawyer fees. To help ease the process, the IRS allows new parents an adoption credit worth up to $13,460 for 2016. And if parents adopt a special-needs child, they can take the full credit even if their expenses totaled less than the value of the credit. For 2016, the credit starts to phase out when modified AGI exceeds $201,920 and is completely phased out when AGI hits $241,920.

Health care FSA

Whenever possible, take advantage of an employers flexible spending account (FSA) program, to help pay for medical expenses. These allow employees to use pretax dollars to cover all out-of-pocket medical costs not reimbursed by a health plan. There are no income limitations, but your contribution for 2016 is limited to $2,550.

Dependent-Care FSA

As we mentioned earlier, parents earning more than $43,000 are generally better off signing up for an employers dependent-care flexible spending account (FSA) program. Like health care FSAs, these plans allow taxpayers to set aside pretax dollars for child-care expenses. The tax-law limit is $5,000.

Warning: The only danger with FSAs is that any money that isnt used up to cover qualified expenses is generally lost (you may be able to carry over up to $500 of an unused health care FSA balance to next year). So budget accurately. And dont forget to save those child-care receipts.

Divorce

Finally, you may have noticed that we havent discussed ways divorced parents can divvy up all these tax deductions and credits. As a rule of thumb, the parent with custody for the greater part of the year (the so-called custodial parent) gets to claim them. Of course, sometimes parents share custody, and this can get a little complicated. Whenever possible, try to work these things out early and have them noted in the divorce agreement. This will save headaches at tax return time.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP)  The black man shot to death by a police officer was a father of two who was quick to flash a smile or give a hug, yet someone who had a troubled relationship with police and was wanted on charges of selling cocaine.

Akiel Denkins, 24, died Monday after a foot pursuit with an officer serving a felony arrest warrant. The officer chased Denkins over a fence and fired multiple shots in a backyard behind a modest home, according to police and witnesses.

The police shooting angered residents in this predominantly African-American neighborhood and comes as officers face perhaps more scrutiny than ever over their treatment of young black men. The officer's race was not released and police gave out few details, other than saying a gun was found near Denkins.

""He had some troubles, but he was a good guy,"" said Pastor Chris Jones of the Ship of Zion, who uses patience and prayer to convince young men in the community to give up drug dealing and other troubled paths.

Truvalia Bailey said she bumped into Denkins about 10 minutes before the shooting and he ""hugged me around the neck.""

""It happens everywhere,"" she said of the police shootings, her voice hoarse and breaking with emotion. ""But it finally hit Raleigh.""

Frustration with police was evident in the hours after the shooting, with some chanting ""no justice, no peace"" at the edge of a police cordon.

The atmosphere was calmer Tuesday in the neighborhood of one-story houses and small clusters of apartments. Residents say they have a complicated relationship with police.

More than a half-dozen churches sit within a half-mile of where shooting took place, and three area pastors chose measured responses such as ""somewhat peaceful,"" ''decent"" or ""respectful"" when asked to describe interactions between the community and officers. Some people complained that crime in the area is driven by outsiders coming in at night to buy and sell drugs.

Denkins had children ages 1 and 2, said the Rev. William Barber II, the head of the North Carolina National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

""Did he have faults? All human beings have faults. Some reports say he had an arrest record. So do I,"" Barber told reporters Tuesday.

View gallery Rolonda Byrd, who says she is the mother of shooting victim Akiel Denkins, cries during a news confe 

But Barber said neither a warrant nor an arrest record ""is a license to kill"" and he called for a fair and transparent investigation.

Denkins' mother, Rolonda Byrd, had tears streaming down her face as she stood next to Barber. She said she went to the medical examiner's office, but wasn't allowed to look at her son's body.

""They stopped me at the door. Somehow they knew I was on my way,"" Byrd said.

A day earlier, she questioned the police officer's use of force.

""Why wasn't there a Taser pulled out to Taser him while he was jumping over that fence? What happened to beanbags guns? They used to use those to stop a criminal. They don't do that anymore. Now it's just bullets  all bullets. Why?"" she said.

The police department identified the officer involved in the shooting as senior officer D.C. Twiddy, 29. He has been placed on administrative leave while the State Bureau of Investigation looks into the matter.

Shooting witness Claresa Williams said she was standing in front of her apartment when she saw an officer drive up.

""When the police came, he jumped the fence"" into the backyard of a house next door, Williams told The Associated Press. ""The officer jumped the fence, pulled his gun out and shot him down six times.""

Williams said her view was blocked so she didn't see the man fall from the bullets.

""To me, you pulled your gun out and you fired at that man six times in his back because he was running,"" Williams said.

Denkins had previous drug convictions and was released on $10,000 secured bond in October after being charged with selling cocaine, according to court documents. He failed to show up for a court date and an order for his arrest was filed Friday.

On Tuesday morning, several young men gathered at a makeshift memorial with balloons and flowers to take pictures and write messages about ""Lock Man"" on large pieces of poster board.

Jones, the pastor, said he and Denkins had good conversations at the Galley Grocery Store, which is operated by Jones' church.

""A big smile would come on his face, and he would say 'What's up Pastor Chris?'"" Jones said.

Denise Brimley, who works at the Galley, said Denkins usually ordered two chili dogs and a can of grape soda. She said she was thinking about his two children: ""It's really sad that young man isn't going to get to see them grow up.""

On Monday, about 100 construction workers walked off the job, protesting the presence of workers from across the border. Across the Nevada border, that is.

The local builders union is angry that employees from New Mexico and Arizona are working on the project, according to the Reno Gazette-Journal. Adding insult to injury, the out-of-state workers are also non-union laborers, the paper noted.

While hiring across state lines is rarely as controversial as employing foreign workershow would New York banks function without commuters from New Jersey and Connecticut?it matters in Nevada. Thats because the state gave Tesla $1.25 billion in tax incentives to land the factory in 2014. Part of the deal negotiated by Gov. Brian Sandovalwhose name was recently floated as a possible Supreme Court nomineerequires at least 50% of the projects workers be state residents. (In a uniquely Nevada twist, Teslas Gigafactory is being constructed on land developed by Lance Gillman, owner of the Mustang Ranch brothel, a legal enterprise in the state).

Tesla says the dispute is between the union and one of its contractors, and that local employees are above the 50% threshold.

In reality, more than 50% of the workers used by this contractor and more than 75% of the entire Gigafactory workforce are Nevada residents, demonstrating the projects strong commitment to Nevada, the company told Quartz in an emailed statement.

Tesla expects the Gigafactory to reach full production in 2020, making enough batteries to power the 500,000 cars it expects to be producing annually by then. The factorys name reflects the companys ambition to make enough batteries in a year to produce 35 gigawatt-hours of electricity. A gigawatt is the equivalent of 1 billion watts."
"130","Never Trump and the Rise of a New Republican Respectability Politics.txt",458,884,46,"Youve struck a chord w/American ppl, the freshman Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, tweeted to Donald Trump the week before the Iowa caucuses. If I were bettingyoure likely next POTUS . Congrats. He went on, But  at the same time, we have questions about how you would govern. Sasseforty-four years old, equipped with a Yale doctorate in history, unaffiliated in the Presidential racebegan to list them. You brag abt many affairs w/ married women. Have you repented? To harmed children & spouses? Do you think it matters? Sasse noted Trumps fixation on strength. Do you agree that exec unilateralism is very bad? Because you talk A LOT about running the country,  he wrote. Within twenty-four hours, Sasse had flown to Iowa and appeared at rallies for both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, wearing a red Nebraska Cornhuskers pullover. The Senator, in other words, did precisely what the Partys establishment would not: mount a moral case against Trump and then fly from D.C. to the heartland to try to stall the real-estate moguls momentum.

Now, finally, Trumps dominance of the race has brought the opposition into focus. During the past week, as Super Tuesday neared and the betting markets put Trumps chances of winning the nomination at eighty percent, conservatives expressed their hostility toward him outright, many using the Twitter hashtag #NeverTrump. Sasse announced that he would leave the Party if Trump were the nominee. Right-wing talk-radio hosts made it clear that they would oppose Trump in the general election. I just dont think nationalistic authoritarianism vs. progressive socialism is of much interest for this Christian, the Iowa radio host Steve Deace said on Twitter. If Trump became President, he would be an authoritarian despot, deeply destructive to the ideals of this nation and the constitutional principles of the republic, Erick Erickson, a right-wing radio host from Atlanta, wrote on his Web site. On Monday, Democracy Corps, a nonprofit run by the Clinton veterans James Carville and Stanley Greenberg, released the results of a survey of eight hundred Republican base voters, which found that one in five were poised to defect from the party.

Over the weekend, the Bloomberg columnist Megan McArdle issued an open call to her readers. She wanted to hear from lifelong Republicans who were so revolted by the possibility of a Trump nomination that they were planning to sit out the election. By Monday, McArdle had received hundreds of responses. What surprised me? she wrote. First, the sheer number of people who sat down and composed lengthy emails over the weekend. Second, the passion they showed. These people are not quietly concerned about Trump. They are appalled, repulsed, afraid and dismayed that their party could have let this happen.

McArdle separately posted many of the responses she received, and, reading through them, something else stands out, too: how much the conservative abhorrence of Trump echoes the liberal one. Trumps demagoguery, sexism, and disdain for knowledge and substance are anathema to me, one of McArdles correspondents wrote. Another enumerated Trumps boasts about sexual conquests and the moral superiority he associated with wealth and concluded, He embodies virtually everything I strive to teach my young sons not to be and not to emulate. A third reported the disgust of his mother, a Pentecostal Sunday-school teacher, at Trumps amoralitymore than anything, the air of misogyny he puffs out every time he speaks brings back to her mind all of the dismissive men she has toiled under and been passed over [for] during her career. A former intelligence analyst in Afghanistan wrote in; so did a career Marine Corps officer; so did someone who had enlisted just after 9/11. A buffoon, another of McArdles correspondents wrote, which summed up the general mood.

If the Never Trump movement gathers momentum, it will be not as a revolt of the establishment but, more simply, as a result of the established: the Sunday-school teachers, the Marine officers, the churchgoers. (The more a voter goes to church, analysts have found, the less likely he or she is to vote for Trump.) They are not necessarily more moderate than the Trump voters: the writer Evan Soltas found, in an analysis of New Hampshire primary results, that as precincts grew more liberal, they grew more likely to vote for Trump. But they are, as we have often heard, and Soltas found, more educated. If the Pentecostal Sunday-school teachers and career Marine officers dominated Republican electoral politics, Trump would not be moving rapidly toward the nomination. But the threat of the Never Trump voters is a reminder that political coalitions tend to be zero sum: reach for a new group of voters and you risk losing a group of older ones.

In this election, that movement may be happening along a strange and unexpected axis: we are seeing the rise of a conservative respectability politics. For many years, from the 2000 election forward, the line that divided red states from blue seemed to supply the basic rupture in American society. That division was cultural, and it put, say, a public-school teacher from the Bronx and an evangelical Sunday-school teacher from Alabama in ferociously opposed political camps. Now, in the face of Trump, the space between them looks somewhat less like a line of scrimmage and somewhat more like a mirror."

A search for her began on Sunday after a paper published an article about her alleged abduction, prompting a social media campaign demanding she be freed.

Her family say she was abducted from the south in August by a man who forced her to convert to Islam before marrying her in the northern city of Kano.

The man denies it was against her will.

The alleged abduction has ignited the debate about child brides and forced marriages in Nigeria.

The UN said more than one in three girls are married before the age of 18, mostly in poor rural families in Africa.

The family say they have made several efforts to bring Ese back from Kano, some 900km (600 miles) away from her home in southern Bayelsa state, but were told she was no longer their daughter.

There have been some 50,000 tweets using the hashtag #FreeEse since Sunday to put pressure on the authorities to rescue the girl.

The alleged abductor of the girl was a long-standing customer of Ese's mother, who is a food vendor, reports the BBC's Chris Ewokor from the capital, Abuja.

Prominent girls' rights activist and former World Bank Director Oby Ezekwesili and human rights campaigners have called for the prosecution of all those involved in the alleged kidnapping.

"133","No breakthrough in Supreme Court dispute between Obama, Republicans.txt",221,426,19,"By Ayesha Rascoe

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders of the Senate on Tuesday rebuffed President Barack Obama's appeal for hearings and a vote on his U.S. Supreme Court nominee during a face-to-face meeting that failed to budge them from their vow to block any nominee he offers.

Obama, planning to name a replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia in the coming weeks, huddled with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley in the White House Oval Office for less than an hour.

""Senator Grassley and I made it clear that we don't intend to take up a nominee or to have a hearing,"" McConnell told reporters after the meeting.

The meeting failed to produce any progress on how to proceed with finding a replacement for Scalia, a long-serving conservative justice who died on Feb. 13.

McConnell and Grassley are insistent that Obama not pick a nominee and leave the decision to his successor, who takes office next January after the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Obama is insistent that it is the Republican-led Senate's constitutional duty to act on his nominee.

""They made clear in their meeting with the president that they're not going to change their mind just because the president says so,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said of the Republicans.

Earnest said Obama still believes it was worthwhile to consult with the lawmakers before making his nomination.

Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Obama stated during the meeting he would be willing to consider candidates for the Supreme Court proposed by the Republicans, but McConnell and Grassley offered no names.

""We killed a lot of time talking about basketball and other stuff,"" said Reid, who attended along with the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Patrick Leahy.

Under the Constitution, the president nominates Supreme Court justices and the Senate must confirm them. Without Scalia, the court has four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning any potential Obama nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades.

McConnell and Grassley have said allowing the next president to pick the new justice would let voters have a say in the selection when they elect a new president.

""Whether everybody in the meeting today wanted to admit it, we all know that considering a nomination in the middle of a heated presidential campaign is bad for the nominee, bad for the court, bad for the process and ultimately bad for the nation,"" Grassley said in a statement.

GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea will boycott any session of the U.N. Human Rights Council that examines its record and will ""never, ever"" be bound by any such resolutions, its foreign minister said on Tuesday.

The announcement signaled further isolation of North Korea whose leadership has been accused by U.N. investigators of committing crimes against humanity and is poised to be hit with fresh U.N. sanctions for its nuclear program.

Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong also accused the United States, Japan and South Korea of sending agents into his country to recruit criminals to become ""so-called North Korean defectors"".

""As a way out and in order to earn their living, they are compelled to continue to fabricate and sell groundless testimonies by trying to make them sound as shocking as possible,"" Ri said in a speech to the 47-member state forum.

South Korea rejected the accusations, saying that ""questioning the credibility of the defectors' testimony is nothing but a denial of truth"". Japan urged Pyongyang to take concrete actions to improve human rights at home.

""We shall no longer participate in international sessions singling out the human rights situation of the DPRK (North Korea) for mere political attack,"" Ri said.

Any resolutions adopted against the DPRK ""will be none of our business and we will never ever be bound by them"", he said.

Ri said the U.N. rights forum was marked by worsening ""politicization, selectivity and double standards"", and criticized gun-related violence in the United States and Europe's migrant crisis.

Japan and South Korea are drafting a resolution for debate at the ongoing four-week session to renew the mandate of the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, currently Marzuki Darusman, and may seek further steps.

Darusman, in a report last month, asked the United Nations to officially notify North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that he may be investigated for crimes against humanity, in line with the findings of a landmark 2014 U.N. report.

The U.N. Security Council delayed until Wednesday a vote on a U.S.-Chinese drafted resolution that would dramatically expand U.N. sanctions on North Korea after Russia said it needed more time to review the text, diplomats said.

The expanded sanctions, if adopted, would require inspections of all cargo going to and from North Korea and blacklisting of North Koreans active in Syria, Iran and Vietnam.

Meanwhile, a never-married man age 65 and over lives on a median income of $28,250, versus $25,790 for a never-married woman, according to the report, which analyzed U.S. Census survey data.

The income disparity is greater for widows and divorced women. Widowers aged 65 and over live on a median annual income of $30,620 versus $23,990 for widows. Divorced men age 65 and older live on an annual median income of $36,910, versus $27,600 for divorced women of the same age.

Future retirees may fare even worse, since fewer will have guaranteed income from pensions than todays retirees. Female workers of all ages had median 401(k) account balances of $24,446 in 2014, versus $36,875 for males, among Vanguards plan participants.

Women sock away less despite being 14% more likely than men to participate in their workplace savings plan, according to Vanguard, and despite having similar asset allocations to men, with an average of 73% of their 401(k) in stocks to mens 74%.

Various policies have been proposed to close the retirement income gap, from increasing workers access to retirement savings plans to a proposal by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to expand Social Security benefits for widows and those who took time out of the paid workforce to care for a child or sick family member.

Women can also take matters into their own hands and plan for a lengthy retirement either on their own or with the help of a financial adviser, Mustin said.

"136","Olympic Games_ French prosecutors to investigate 2016 and 2020 bids.txt",336,717,30,"Lamine Diack became IAAF president in 1999

French prosecutors have widened their investigation into corruption in athletics to include the bidding and voting processes for the hosting of the 2016 and 2020 Olympics.

Lamine Diack, the former president of world governing body the IAAF, is already being investigated by French authorities.

He was arrested last year on corruption and money laundering charges, over allegations he took payments for deferring sanctions against Russian drugs cheats.

Confirming the investigation was being widened, an official from the prosecutor's office said: ""We are looking at these elements, but at this stage it is a question of verification. Nothing has been proved.""

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has told the BBC it wants to be a party to the French investigations.

Tokyo, which will host the 2020 Olympics, defended the voting process when it came under scrutiny in January.

And Rio 2016 organisers said on Tuesday that the city ""won the right to host the Games because it had the best project"".

""The difference in the votes, 66 to 32 against Madrid, excludes any possibility of an election that could have been rigged,"" communications director Mario Andrada said.

The background

Diack, 82, was head of the International Association of Athletics Federations for 16 years until he stepped down last August.

He resigned as an honorary member of the IOC in November - a day after being provisionally suspended by the organisation following the start of the French investigation.

In December, a World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) report into alleged IAAF corruption claimed Diack had been prepared to sell his vote to decide on the host city for the 2020 Games in exchange for sponsorship of IAAF events.

Diack's son Papa Massata, who was employed by his father as a marketing consultant for the IAAF, is also under investigation, and a warrant for his arrest has been issued by Interpol.

Last month, Wada investigators called for a follow-up inquiry into all World Championships awarded by the IAAF for 2009-2019 after finding evidence of possible wrongdoing.

Diack Jr has been banned for life by the IAAF but told the BBC in December he and his father were innocent of the claims against them.

Prosecutors are now looking into whether the alleged corruption could have extended to vote-rigging.

The Guardian claimed last year that - according to leaked emails - Diack Jr requested a payment of $5m from Doha in 2011, shortly before a decision was made about the city's unsuccessful bid for the 2017 World Championships. The Doha bid denies any wrongdoing.

In January, the newspaper reported he apparently arranged for ""parcels"" to be delivered to six IOC members in 2008, when Qatar was bidding for the 2016 Olympics, which will be hosted by Rio.

An IOC spokesman said the organisation had been in close contact with French prosecutors since the beginning of this investigation.

He added: ""The IOC's chief ethics and compliance officer had already asked for the IOC to be fully informed in a timely manner of all issues that may refer to Olympic matters and has already applied to become a party to the investigations led by the French judicial authorities.""

Analysis

BBC sports editor Dan Roan:

With the disgraced former president of the IAAF - Lamine Diack - having served as an IOC member between 1999 and 2013, investigators will want to know whether he could have influenced a bloc of voters when it came to deciding Olympic hosts.

Since the 1999 Salt Lake City bribery scandal blew the lid on systematic corruption within the IOC, it has overhauled its rules, and regained trust in the integrity of its bidding process.

But being dragged into the sprawling French probe into the IAAF's doping and extortion scandal will be something of a reality check for an organisation that has portrayed itself as a good example to crisis-hit governing bodies of sports such as football and cycling.

Last month, Wada commission chief Dick Pound said he was ""fairly certain"" the IOC was free of organised corruption, and the widening of this inquiry does not mean we are heading for a sensational revote of Tokyo 2020.

But with investigators now taking a closer look at the bidding for an event as prestigious as the Olympics, the reputation of sport's most powerful figures will be called into question yet again."

The prosecution case against a man accused of murdering 29 people in the Real IRA bomb attack in Omagh, County Tyrone, in 1998 has collapsed.

Seamus Daly, a 45-year-old bricklayer from Jonesborough, County Armagh, was also accused of causing the explosion but he denied the charges against him.

The Public Prosecution Service decided there was no reasonable prospect of conviction so have withdrawn the case.

Mr Daly was released from Maghaberry prison on Tuesday afternoon.

The prosecution case was withdrawn after a key witness gave inconsistent evidence and contradicted his previous testimony.

Campaigner Michael Gallagher, whose son was killed by the bomb, said the victims' families felt they have lost the ""last chance that we had for justice"".

Media caption Relatives of some of the people killed in the 1998 Omagh bomb have said they feel 'let down' by the criminal justice system after the collapse of the case

The Omagh bomb was the biggest single atrocity in the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

It happened just four months after the Good Friday Agreement was signed.

The death toll included nine children and three generations of one family, but no-one has been convicted in a criminal court of carrying out the attack.

Mr Daly is originally from County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland but now lives in Northern Ireland.

Along with County Louth man Colm Murphy, he was found liable for the bomb in a civil retrial in 2013.

The action was taken by the victims' families, who were awarded 1.6m damages.

Vincent Kearney, Home Affairs Correspondent

Seamus Daly was in court in Omagh last week for a hearing to decide if there was enough evidence for the case to proceed.

He was not in court in Ballymena today, when a prosecution lawyer announced that the answer to that question was ""No"".

The case was based on evidence from a witness about a phone used by members of the Real IRA who planted the bomb.

A judge who heard evidence last week had been due to announce today if the case would continue.

But the decision was taken out of his hands when a lawyer said the case no longer met the test for prosecution.

The prosecution had relied upon a star witness to link Seamus Daly to a mobile phone used by the Omagh bombers. He told them that Daly had called him from that phone on the day of the bombing.

But during court hearings last week, he conceded he may have been mistaken and that the call could have taken place a week earlier.

At that point, the prosecution case effectively fell apart.

This may not be the end of the matter.

Seamus Daly was one of four men ordered to pay more than 1.5m in damages to the families of those killed in the Omagh bombing after they took a civil action.

His lawyer today said much of the evidence in that case was provided by the same key witness who had been due to give evidence in this criminal trial.

He said the judgement in the civil case will now be appealed.

In the criminal trial, Mr Daly was also accused of two charges relating to another dissident republican bomb plot in Lisburn, County Antrim, in April 1998.

After his arrest, Mr Daly gave police a statement denying any involvement in the Omagh bombing or Lisburn plot.

His lawyers argued that the case against him was weak and much of the evidence had been discredited.

Mr Gallagher, who has led the campaign for justice for many years, said he was unhappy that information was circulating on Tuesday morning about the collapse of the case, yet claimed he and other families had not been told by the authorities.

""We have been failed once again by the police service, by the prosecution service, by the government and by the criminal justice system,"" he said.

'This is the last chance that we had for justice and we've now lost that last chance.""

Mr Gallagher said not many of the victims' relatives attended court because ""most families have given up on justice, they've given up on the criminal justice system because they've been let down so many times"".

Media caption Claire Monteith's brother, Alan Radford ,was killed in the bombing

In a statement on Tuesday, the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said the decision not to seek the return of Mr Daly for trial to the Crown Court had been taken ""following a careful review of the current state of the evidence"".

It said this had focused in particular on the testimony provided by a key witness during committal proceedings last week.

""Under cross-examination a number of issues became apparent which impacted upon the reliability of the evidence that the witness was providing,"" a PPS spokesperson added.

""Having conducted a careful review of the case with the prosecution team, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Barra McGrory QC has concluded that the available evidence no longer provides a reasonable prospect of a conviction. Consequently the prosecution cannot be continued.""

The PPS spokesperson expressed sympathy to ""the families affected by the Omagh bomb"".

""We understand how difficult this decision will be for them,"" they said.

""We hope they are assured that this decision was not taken lightly but is required in accordance with our duty as prosecutors to keep a decision under review and to discontinue criminal proceedings when the test for prosecution is no longer met.""

Barra McGrory said: ""I have great sympathy with the families affected by the Omagh bomb and share their disappointment that we are in a position where we are unable to progress this prosecution.

""There is a shared determination by ourselves and police to take forward the prosecution of those responsible if any new evidence to support this becomes available,"" he said."

"139","One of the Stranger Jobs in Texas.txt",317,572,17,"In 2006, the New Yorker staff writer Katherine Boo wrote a piece, titled Swamp Nurse, about a year that she spent shadowing a woman named Luwana Marts, who had, in Boos words, one of the stranger jobs in the Louisiana state bureaucracy. Marts was working in a program called the Nurse-Family Partnership, which sends nurses on regular visits to young mothers living in poverty in the southern parishes of Terrebonne and Lafourche. Boo described how Marts and her fellow-nurses try to address, simultaneously, the continual crises of poverty and the class-transcending anxiety of maternity: this creature is inexplicable to me.

The program was based on the theories of a developmental psychologist named David Olds, who argues that, by the time children who are born into high-risk homes get to preschool, its often already too late, from a developmental standpoint, to make effective interventions in their lives. He started a network of local partnerships such as the one Marts worked for, and the children and mothers enrolled in them showed a marked improvement in health and well-being when compared with their peers, including a reduction in incidents of abuse. Boos story captures the personal relationship between nurse and motherbuilt slowly and not without its own complicationsthats the foundation of the program.

In the latest episode of The New Yorker Presents, available now on Amazon, the filmmaker Dawn Porter travels to Port Arthur, Texas, to follow a nurse named Nicole Schroeder who works in the Nurse-Family Partnership there. Schroeder herself was a young mother (And what are you gonna do about that? she recalls her mother saying after hearing about the pregnancy), so she understands, in a very real way, what its like to have a child when you are struggling with finances and other challenges, Porter said in an e-mail.

As Schroeder makes her rounds to visit her clientsmy girls, she calls themshe functions not just as a medical adviser but as a confidant and mentor, coaching the mothers through education, employment, and relationship decisions. She shows a nineteen-year-old mother the soft spot on her babys head, advises a sixteen-year-old on custody issues, and comforts an eighteen-year-old whose own parents have both passed away. Since completing the film, Porter has received encouraging updates from Schroeder about two of the mothers featured: Katerina, sixteen, who was out of school at the time the film was made, has renrolled in high school, and Monique, eighteen, who had to stop working because she couldnt afford childcare, has found a new job.

Although the nurse-visitation program is by no means a magic bullet to address childhood poverty, as Boos piece demonstrates at length, Porters documentary, Lone Star Nurse, captures how a young woman with few other resources greatly benefits from a regular dose of dogged encouragement from someone like Schroeder. She sees the good and potential in everyone, Porter said, and she uses her considerable talents to help them see that in themselves.

In addition to Lone Star Nurse, Episode 7 of The New Yorker Presents includes cartoons by Liana Finck and Farley Katz, a visit with the architect who is redesigning Times Square, and a look at the photography of the singer-songwriter Courtney Barnett. Episode 6, also released today, features an adaptation of a Miranda July short story, Lawrence Weschler on the unique light of Los Angeles, and Adam Gopnik on Americas epidemic of incarceration.

"140","Osama bin Laden wanted much of his fortune used 'on jihad'.txt",395,839,36,"WASHINGTON (AP)  In his handwritten will, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden claimed he had about $29 million in personal wealth  the bulk of which he wanted to be used ""on jihad, for the sake of Allah.""

The will was released Tuesday in a batch of more than 100 documents seized in a May 2011 raid that killed bin Laden at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

The al-Qaida leader planned to divide his fortune among his relatives, but wanted most of it spent to conduct the work of the Islamic extremist terror network behind the Sept. 11 attacks. The will did not disclose much detail about where he amassed his wealth, but bin Laden's father ran a successful construction company in Saudi Arabia for years, and the will noted that $12 million was from his brother on behalf of the Bin Laden Co.

The threat of sudden death also worried other family members.

""If I am to be killed,"" a bin Laden son wrote to his father in a 2008 letter, ""pray for me a lot and give continuous charities in my name, as I will be in great need for support to reach the permanent home."" The letter was signed, ""Your son, Sa'ad Bin Usama,"" according to the U.S. translation from Arabic.

The letters were included in a batch of documents released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. They address a range of topics, including fractures between al-Qaida and al-Qaida in Iraq, which eventually splintered off into what is now known as the Islamic State; and bin Laden's concerns about his organization's public image and his desire to depict it as a united network.

In a letter to one of his wives who had been living in Iran, bin Laden expressed worry that her visit to a dentist could have presented the Iranians an opportunity to implant a small chip under her skin, apparently as a tracking device.

""My dear wife,"" he began. ""I was told that you went to a dentist in Iran, and you were concerned about a filling she put in for you. Please let me know in detail ... any suspicions that any of the brothers may have about chips planted in any way.""

The Iranian dentist might have used a slightly enlarged syringe to make such an implant, bin Laden wrote in the letter. The U.S. translation is undated.

""The size of the chip is about the length of a grain of wheat and the width of a fine piece of vermicelli,"" bin Laden said. He asked her to recall the exact date of her dental work, ""also about any surgery you had, even if it was only a quick pinch.""

In another letter, addressed to ""The Islamic Community in General,"" bin Laden offered an upbeat assessment of progress in his holy war since 9/11 and of U.S. failings in Afghanistan. The letter is undated but appears to have been written in 2010.

""Here we are in the tenth year of the war, and America and its allies are still chasing a mirage, lost at sea without a beach,"" he wrote.

""They thought that the war would be easy and that they would accomplish their objectives in a few days or a few weeks, and they did not prepare for it financially, and there is no popular support that would enable it to carry on a war for a decade or more. The sons of Islam have opposed them and stood between them and their plans and objectives.""

Bin Laden sought to portray the U.S. as hopelessly mired in an unwinnable war in Afghanistan. In an undated letter that appears to have been written in the 2009-2010 period, he compared the American combat position to that of the Soviet Union in the final years of its occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.

""America appears to be hanging on by a thin thread. Due to the financial difficulties,"" he wrote.

""We need to be patient a bit longer. With patience, there is victory!""

Beginning last summer, the CIA spearheaded an interagency review of the classified documents under the auspices of the White House's National Security Council staff. Representatives from seven agencies combed through the documents.

""This was no easy feat as members of the task force dedicated themselves over a long period of time working in an intelligence community facility to review and declassify as many documents as possible,"" said Brian Hale, a spokesman for the national intelligence director.""

The review is ongoing, with the next release expected later this year.

Shortly before his death, bin Laden hailed the overthrow and death of Libya's strongman leader Moammar Gadhafi.

In a Feb. 25, 2011 letter addressed ""to our people in Libya,"" bin Laden said al-Qaida had triumphed over Gadhafi.

""Praise God, who made al-Qa'ida a great vexation upon him, squatting on his chest, enraging and embittering him, and who made al-Qa'ida a torment and exemplary punishment upon him, this truly vile hallucinating individual who troubles us in front of the world!"" he wrote."

The red carpet of the Academy Awards is still the best example of Hollywoods love for pageantry; its an event devoted to the fantasy of glamour that fashion can provide. The tradition began at a time when it was far more difficult to see actors outside of the studiothe red carpet was once a place where you could catch Joan Crawford for an autograph or get a chance to shake Rock Hudsons hand. Over time, of course, it evolved into its own spectacle. As Nicholas Schmidle noted in a recent piece about the Los Angeles-based gossip Web site TMZ.com, the economy behind celebrity image is so lucrative that we see more pictures of movie stars out and about in their everyday livesJennifer Lawrence leaving the grocery store; Ryan Gosling paying for the parkingthan we do of them on the red carpet. All the mug shots and bad selfies add to the pleasure of seeing stars buffed and polished, zipped into swanky gowns and buttoned into tuxedos for the night; the contrast alone can be stunning. When Naomi Watts arrived in a dazzling gown by Armani Priv, I thought, for some reason, of a paparazzi photo of her from years ago, in which she was shown walking around downtown Manhattan, heavily pregnant, in blue jeans and silver-thonged Birkenstocks.

Wattss getup was among a handful of standout dresses in the lineup last night. Saoirse Ronans emerald Calvin Kleinfitted at her natural waist, with a plunging neckline and cutouts along the side and backwas especially beautiful. Im proud to be Irish, she said. But it wasnt so much that she looked Irish as she did her ageyoung, elegant, and unfussy. (The silhouette of the dresss straps reminded me of another trend: wearing a one-piece American Apparel bathing suit under your blue jeans, as Gillian Jacobss character does in an episode of the Netflix series Love.) Rachel McAdams wore green, too, in a slinky silk frock with a halter-top and a long, Angelina-like slit up her right leg. It was by a relatively unknown designer, the young August Getty, and I give McAdamss stylist points for nudging her away from the pantheon of greatsDior, Chanel, Armaniusually reserved for this occasion. McAdams, having become one of Americas sweethearts, has room to be a little edgy.

Not that there was anything wrong with the classics. Charlize Theron stunned in a red Dior dress, a glittering diamond pendant necklace hanging from her neck. I literally started clapping, Tina Fey said. Shes so beautiful. Theron always looks appropriately sexy and yet, at the same time, completely too cool to be so dressed upI suspect I wasnt the only one hoping for Imperator Furiosa to arrive instead, still dusty from the apocalypse, wearing pants. Julianne Moore looked fantastic in a black, demure dress from Chanel; Charlotte Rampling was dressed in a beaded Armani Priv, with a jewel neckline and long sleeves. (Was the dress especially chic or was it just the Rampling effect, dinged but still, it seems, intact after her recent unfortunate comments about the Academys failure to recognize actors of color?) The great Cate Blanchett wore Armani Priv, too, a sea-foam number with large floral appliques that bloomed from her shoulders and cascaded down to the hem. Its a bit wild to remember that Armani was one of the first designers to dominate the red carpet. In the nineties, he was all about neutral colors and minimalist lines; find a photo of the brown Armani dress Julia Roberts wore in 1990 and try to imagine anyone wearing that to the Academy Awards today. Itd be impossible. Armani has a reputation like filet mignon; hes supposed to be a cut above the rest. Every year, there are dresses that make it down the runway that would be perfect for the Oscars if one were willing to be slightly more adventurousfrom Rodarte to Proenza Schouler to Alexander McQueenbut every year, there are Hollywoods top actresses, clad in Armani, again. His dresses can be impeccably flattering but also a little boring, and you can see how his long-standing success on the red carpet is just as much about the status and privilege in which luxury traffics as it is his craft.

Newcomer Alicia Vikander wore perhaps the nights most controversial dress, a buttery yellow Louis Vuitton with silver embroidered rectangles spattered across the bust and down the skirt. When I first saw it, I didnt like ityellow is a notoriously difficult color to pull offbut later, as she walked up the stage to accept her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, I loved it. What had changed? Vikander is a recently minted star; she has plenty of red carpets in her future to be conventional. She isnt interested in looking avant garde, like Rooney Mara, whose obsession with weird is unexcitingtheres a celebrity who relies on fashion a little too much to create mystery. Vikanders style is more like that of Lupita Nyongo: hopeful, pretty, and playful. I imagine a lot of young woman will emulate Vikanders earthy but European look as her career grows. You dont have to love the dress, but it had an effectsometimes, thats the point.

Tina Fey and Reese Witherspoon both wore purple, an unfortunate pairing. They are both regal women, but Witherspoon ended up the dumpier bridesmaid in a boned bodice, breast-cupping Oscar de la Renta. Olivia Munn looked fantastic in an orange Stella McCartney, even if her attitude, perpetually flip, didnt particularly match what she was wearing. Brie Larson looked great in her blue Gucci, but the dress wore her, and not the other way around, which is a mistake for such a brilliant actress. Emily Blunt was perfect in ballet-pink Prada. The best-dressed person of the night, however, had to be Chris Rock, who, even if he had less opportunity for error, clothing-wise, still had the hardest gig in town. Fashion can be your armor, as evidenced by Kerry Washingtons leather Versace breastplate. Rocks white tuxedo was simple but flawless."

Both instances were a reminder, comedic or otherwise, to keep pushing for greater diversity prompted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' mostly white list of nominees for a second year in a row. And fighting the power is what the #OscarsSoWhite movement plans to continue doing.

Here are the ways some proponents of increased diversity believe the conversation can continue now that awards season is over.

April Reign, creator of #OscarsSoWhite:



I would encourage everybody to be more mindful of the movies on which they spend their hard earned money. If the cast does not look like them, does not represent their stories, perhaps choose not to see their films and instead seek out stories that tell the diversity and the beauty and nuance of all people.

Gil Robertson, president of the African American Film Critics Assn.:



I want to see the putting together of a multicultural group of journalists to continue this conversation. It's important that we do that because the way the conversation has been had traditionally is in black and white terms. I think it is important that we encourage our Hispanic and Asian and other brothers and sisters to also be vocal, and to give them room to be vocal. We need to work collaboratively to see results.

Thousands of Pakistanis have turned out for the funeral of a former bodyguard executed for killing Punjab's governor over his opposition to blasphemy laws.

Security was tight as a crowd of about 30,000 gathered to pay their last respects to Mumtaz Qadri in Rawalpindi.

Qadri was hailed as a hero by Islamists for the 2011 killing of Salman Taseer, who wanted to reform the strict laws.

Thousands of police were deployed along the route of the funeral procession and in the nearby capital, Islamabad.

Qadri supporters threw rose petals on his coffin, Reuters reports from Liaquat Bagh park where the funeral was held.

""He lives! Qadri lives!"" mourners chanted, the news agency reported. ""From your blood, the revolution will come!""

Security forces kept their distance and stick-wielding activists of the hardline Sunni Tehreek movement, which organised the funeral prayers, controlled the crowd.

The coffin was then taken in its flower-strewn ambulance some 20km (12.5 miles) north to Qadri's ancestral village on the eastern outskirts of Islamabad.

His execution on Monday prompted protesters to take to the streets in cities in Pakistan.

But the rallies in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad were mostly peaceful. Demonstrators burned tyres and chanted slogans, as well as blocking some roads into Islamabad.

Media blockade: Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad

When news of Mumtaz Qadri's execution broke, Pakistanis were glued to their television sets in anticipation of riots on the streets by his supporters.

But what protests there were were sporadic and not well attended - and the mood of the mourners at Tuesday's funeral was equally restrained.

More importantly, news anchors of dozens of Pakistani television channels, who would normally be hysterical at such a development, seemed not to notice. So why the media silence when there was a golden chance to boost ratings?

""Obviously, they have been sent a piece of advice by an authority they can't ignore, and that authority is definitely not the political government,"" says Ayesha Siddiqa, a defence and political analyst.

For most in Pakistan, that could only be the military.

Qadri was executed at 04:30 local time (23:30 GMT) at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi on Monday.

He had trained as an elite police commando and was assigned to Salman Taseer as his bodyguard. Qadri shot the politician 28 times at an Islamabad market in January 2011 and was sentenced to death later that year.

He claimed it was his religious duty to kill the minister, who was an outspoken critic of Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws and supported liberal reforms.

Pakistan has seen Islamist groups grow in influence in recent years and several high-profile blasphemy cases.

Blasphemy is an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan and critics argue that blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores and unfairly target minorities.

"145","Possible jurors called for trial between Hulk Hogan, Gawker.txt",347,668,40,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP)  Just before he was about to step into a Florida courtroom Tuesday morning, former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan issued a tweet to his 1.4 million followers.

""Time for the real main event! ""I AM"" going to slam another Giant! Hogan vrs Gawker! Watcha Gonna Do Gawker? Only Justice Brother HH.""

The ""main event"" he was referring to? Not a wrestling smackdown, but a $100 million legal battle with a popular news website over his privacy.

After years of wrangling, a legal fight is unfolding in a Florida courtroom between Hogan and the news and gossip website Gawker over a sex tape the celebrity made with the wife of radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge Clem.

The ex-wrestler, whose legal name is Terry Bollea, sued Gawker after it published parts of the video in 2012. The video was recorded in 2006. He says his privacy was violated, but Gawker says the publication was a legitimate scoop because Hogan had talked openly about his sex life before, in forums such as Howard Stern's radio show.

Hogan is seeking $100 million from Gawker for posting the video of him and Heather Cole, the ex-wife of Clem, Hogan's one-time friend.

Hogan appeared in court wearing all-black, a cross necklace and a black bandanna.

Last year, Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Pamela Campbell ruled that Hogan could wear a plain bandanna in court, a far cry from his usually flashy gear in the ring and on TV.

Jury selection began Tuesday. Nearly 500 potential jurors were summoned; about 100 of those were told to return Wednesday.

Many of the prospective jurors weren't thrilled about the possibility of a weekslong case. Of the 114 who responded to a summons, all but 48 were dismissed by noon. Those who weren't dismissed were asked about their exposure to the story in the news media and whether they follow celebrity news.

In June, Gawker founder Nick Denton told The Associated Press that the fight for the right to publish the video was an important one, both for his news organization and the First Amendment. Denton said Gawker had the right to publish the edited video because Hogan talked in detail about his sex life before the video's release, which made the story newsworthy.

""I care about the readers having the right to know both sides of a story,"" he said. ""Readers should also have the right to get the story behind the celebrity story.""

It is still unknown how the video surfaced in the news media, although a Tampa Police report points to a former employee of Clem's as the possible culprit. The Hillsborough County State Attorney declined to press charges. Although the video was delivered to Gawker anonymously in 2012, other celebrity gossip sites had mentioned the video and at least one published photos.

Gawker posted a one-minute, 41-second clip from the full, 30-minute video.

The yearslong lead-up to the trial has been messy, with attorneys for Hogan accusing Gawker's lawyers of releasing confidential information from the video to the news media. Some of that information included Hogan making racist remarks. Hogan suffered swift backlash: World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. severed ties with him. In a statement, Hogan apologized for using ""offensive language.""

Gawker denied that its lawyers leaked the information and said that many people had copies of the video, along with the audio and the transcript.

Hogan, perhaps the biggest star in WWE's five-decade history, was the main draw for the first WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years in its signature event, facing everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon.

He won six WWE championships and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005 by Sylvester Stallone.

Hogan also became a celebrity outside the base of his ""Hulkamania"" fans, appearing in numerous movies and television shows, including a reality show about his life on VH1, ""Hogan Knows Best.""

"146","Preview_ Kobe Bryant to sit out against Brooklyn Nets to rest shoulder.txt",214,363,24,"Kobe Bryant will sit out Tuesday night when the Lakers (11-49) host the Brooklyn Nets (17-43) at Staples Center.

The Lakers All-Star will miss his second straight game to rest his surgically repaired right shoulder, after missing the team's 112-95 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday.

Bryant is expected to travel to Denver after the game Tuesday, with hopes he'll be able to play against the Nuggets.

Rookie forward Anthony Brown is likely to start in Bryant's place against Brooklyn.

Now on an eight-game losing streak, the Lakers have had three full days to practice in anticipation of the Nets.

Brooklyn will play without Jarrett Jack (knee) and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (ankle), while former Lakers guard Wayne Ellington is a game-time decision (head).

The Nets recently waived veteran guard/forward Joe Johnson, who has since joined the Miami Heat. Brooklyn played the Clippers on Monday night, falling to the Clippers 105-95.

Key matchup

The Nets are led by one of the top offensive centers in the league in Brook Lopez, who is averaging 20.5 points a game, while shooting 50.8% from the field.

Lopez is a somewhat average rebounder for a seven-footer at 8.2 a night. He also blocks 1.8 shots and dishes 1.8 assists per contest.

The Lakers will match up defense-minded center Roy Hibbert against Lopez. Hibbert doesn't get many shots per game (5.4), averaging just 6.3 points but he has the size to contest Lopez.

Behind Hibbert, Brandon Bass (at 6-foot-8) will need to challenge Lopez with energy, effort and agility.

X-factor

The Nets get most of their offense from their front court with Lopez and forward Thaddeus Young.

Young is averaging 15.0 points and 9.1 rebounds a game, shooting 51.1% from the field.

Julius Randle represents the Lakers well at power forward as a ""walking double-double,"" as termed by Coach Byron Scott. On the season, he's at 11.3 points and 10.0 rebounds a night. In February, Randle up-ticked through 10 appearances at 12.9 and 11.8, respectively.

Outlook

Even without Bryant, the Lakers are well-rested and should be able to hand the Nets, who are playing on back-to-back nights.

"147","Puerto Rico braced for more Zika cases.txt",376,830,60,"Image caption Aedes aegypti mosquitoes being studied in CDC lab in San Juan

Hundreds of thousands of people in the US territory of Puerto Rico could become infected with the Zika virus in the coming months, according to the director of America's Centre for Disease Control.

Dr Tom Frieden says this could lead to ""thousands"" of brain-damaged babies.

Zika has now been reported in 31 countries and territories in the Americas, with Brazil the worst hit.

There have been about 100 cases of Zika reported in mainland US.

These were in travellers who had recently returned from Zika-hit countries.

The Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads the virus can be found in about a dozen US states, so the mainland is bracing itself for locally transmitted infections very soon.

Southern states such as Florida and Texas are particularly vulnerable.

But Dr Frieden - who is advising the president on this emergency - says Puerto Rico is the biggest concern for the US.

Media caption US scientists discuss the growing threat posed by Zika

There have been almost 120 cases there so far.

""Close to 90% of adults in Puerto Rico have been infected with dengue [which is transmitted by the same mosquito as Zika] so we need to do everything possible to reduce the risk to pregnant women there,"" Dr Frieden says.

Zika is not considered particularly dangerous in most people, but there is a strongly suspected link between the virus and babies being born with under-developed brains.

""This possible or probable association with microcephaly is extraordinarily unusual,"" says Dr Frieden

""We're not aware of any previous infection spread by mosquitoes that can cause a potentially devastating foetal malformation.""

Zika in the US

93 imported cases, nine of them pregnant women

one baby born with microcephaly

about a dozen states at risk of local Zika transmission

On the frontline of the US' fight against Zika, CDC scientists in Puerto Rico are urgently trying to find new tools to fight these mosquitoes.

The insects have been on the island for many centuries, spreading dengue and, more recently, chikungunya. And they have started to become resistant to the main insecticides used to kill them.

Scientists at the CDC's dengue branch in the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, are urgently trying to establish which insecticides are still effective.

Media caption Take a tour of the CDC's Zika situation room

They are breeding the Zika-transmitting mosquitoes in their labs to test.

The eggs hatch and then undergo metamorphosis from pupae into adult flying mosquitoes within just a few days.

The mosquitoes live only for a couple of weeks, but that is more than enough time to spread disease, and anxiety.

Worryingly, it is becoming increasingly difficult to eliminate them.

""These mosquitoes are resistant to one of the most commonly used insecticides."" says lead entomologist Dr Roberto Barrera.

""Permethrin has been used in Puerto Rico and the rest of the Americas for many years, but it doesn't work as well any more.""

Dr Barrera's team will report back in the next couple of weeks on what other chemicals can be used.

In the meantime, fumigators go through residential areas spraying entire neighbourhoods with the less effective insecticide.

It is the best health authorities here have right now.

Image caption Health officials spray insecticide in a neighbourhood with reported Zika cases

Despite the outbreak, tourism is still strong, with two enormous cruise ships docked in the harbour in old San Juan.

Most people are walking around in shorts and T-shirts, with their arms and legs exposed.

Everyone seems pretty relaxed.

It is only pregnant women who are being advised against travel to Zika-hit areas.

A causative link between Zika and microcephaly has yet to be confirmed.

But until more is known, health officials have to assume there is one.

""There is a lot we don't know,"" Dr Frieden says.

""If an infant is born to a woman who had Zika, and does not have microcephaly, do they have other problems?

""It may not become apparent for months or years to come.""

Image caption Joan Ballista is 28 weeks pregnant. She is extremely anxious about Zika affecting her baby

That uncertainty is constantly on the mind of Joan Ballista, 28.

She is 24 weeks pregnant, and terrified she could become infected - most people who contract the disease do not even know they have it.

She has dropped into a Ministry of Health Women, Infants and Children clinic set up in the city's main shopping centre to give advice to expectant mothers.

""I am very worried"" she says.

""I use repellent every day. I put it on when I wake up, when I go to bed. I really worry. Microcephaly is such a sad disease.""

Advice to travellers

Reconsider travel to Zika-hit countries if you are pregnant

All travellers should avoid getting bitten

Wear long sleeves and trousers

Wear insect repellent

Stay in places with air conditioning or that use window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside

For this weeks episode of Working, were talking with Ikuyo and Yoshio Tanabe, a married couple who run one of D.C.s most iconic Asian markets. And in a Slate Plus extra, Ikuyo talks about what its like to run a travel agency out of the back of a supermarket.

Can you tell us your names and what you do?

Yoshio Tanabe: Yoshio Tanabe. Im a manager.

Ikuyo Tanabe: Im Ikuyo Tanabe. I am a, I guess, helper.

Rachel: Well, technically youre his boss, right?

Ikuyo: Well, you know, we are a company here.

Rachel: And whats that company?

Ikuyo: Its called Galaxy Systems.

Rachel: And you run both a travel agency and a market? Can you tell us a little bit about what the market is?

Ikuyo: Its a Japanese groceries. But we do carry different Asian groceries too, like Chinese, Korean, and Thai. Thai and Malaysia, Vietnam.

Rachel: And the name of the grocery is?

Ikuyo: Hana Market.

Rachel: And does Hana mean anything in Japanese?

Ikuyo: Flower.

Rachel: Thats what I heard. I also heard nose though.

Ikuyo: Oh, yes.

Rachel: Which is kind of similar.

Ikuyo: Yes, can be. Yeah.

Rachel: Do you both work on the grocery store side as well? Or do you split the business completely? Ikuyo, do you do only travel agency stuff?

Ikuyo: No, no, no, no. I help. Yeah. We have lots to do. Especially going to the market to buy stuff. Its a lot of work. So, I help with that too.

Rachel: So, how do you split up the duties?

Ikuyo: It depends how busy we are. You know, on Thursday, we get lots of merchandise from New York. Lots of wholesalers. We get about five wholesalers coming in on Thursday.

Yoshio: We do not have a set schedule. Because were open seven days, 10 to 8. I couldnt remember if each day the time were different. So, I made it easy. Ten to 8. Thats it. Every day, 10 to 8.

Rachel: On Monday morning, what is the first thing that you would do when you get in the store?

Ikuyo: I usually check whats missing and what we need.

Yoshio: He usually does that, not Monday morning but the Sunday night when we close. Then he checks whats been sold and whats needed.

Rachel: So, Sunday night you check whats missing, and then?

Yoshio: Then we have to order it.

Rachel: To order it from?

Yoshio: Order from different

Ikuyo: Different companies, distributors.

Yoshio: Many, many distributors.

Ikuyo: Seven wholesalers.

Ikuyo: Sellers we have to order. So, he does it every day, those orders.

Rachel: How long does that take you? In the morning when youre making those orders, how long does it take you?

Yoshio: No, not only one day! You couldnt finish it. So, actually Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. Three. Three nights. Total, about 12 hours.

Ikuyo: Twelve.

Rachel: Twelve hours to make all the orders for the week?

Yoshio: Every week. Yeah.

Rachel: Ah, for the week. OK.

Ikuyo: Yeah. Every day of the week, different companies come.

Rachel: Right. OK. So, making the orders is a big part of your week, is a big chunk. What else do you do throughout the day at the store?

Yoshio: We prepare the meat and vegetables.

Rachel: Do you cut up the meat and package it?

Yoshio: No. We get the meat cut.

Ikuyo: We have to repack them.

Yoshio: Right. And anyway, what takes the most is the vegetables. Almost every day. At least four or five times we have to go to get vegetables, because we dont have enough space to keep them.

Ikuyo: Yeah. Thats a problem. The small store. He has to reshelve them too. You know, the shelves get empty. Through the back. You have to bring the stuff and reshelve them.

Rachel: So, youre keeping an eye on everything. When it runs out, youre making sure everything is stocked and fresh. Do you deal with customers?

Yoshio: Many American people, you know, recently, they ask many things.

Ikuyo: They come with recipes and they ask whether we have those or not.

Out of a newspaper or a magazine. Yeah, they want to get those recipes, which we never heard of.

Yoshio: Even ramen they try to make from scratch.

Ikuyo: Its amazing. They want to.

Yoshio: People ask us, OK, I need to get this. I dont want to say no, right? So, I try to find it.

Rachel: And when you track it down?

Ikuyo: So, we have to study, you know, what that is and now, we have to the marketability too. We cannot carry everything. So, we have to decide.

Rachel: Whats the most popular item at Hana?

Ikuyo: I guess its sushi products, many people ask for that.

Rachel: Like, the fresh sushi that you saw?

Ikuyo: Fresh sushi. No, not the made one. They want to make their own sushi.

Rachel: Oh, the sushi making.

Ikuyo: So, they ask us what we have forwhat do you call those? The fresh

Rachel: The sashimi, the fresh fish.

Ikuyo: The fresh fish meat to use for sushi making.

And also what they call mochi. Do you know what mochi is?

Its different from Japan. Japanese mochi isits not seasoned. But American people call it mochi, its all seasoned ones. And then with the red beans inside, its a snack, sweet snack. They are very, very popular.

Rachel: With Americans and Japanese?

Ikuyo: Especially Americans. They love mochi.

Rachel: Yeah. Where do you get them?

Ikuyo: Those are hot sellers.

Yoshio: From different distributors.

Ikuyo: Yeah. But most popular ones are handmade from New York. Yeah.

Rachel: Right. And those two items, is that a large part of what you sell during the week? Mochi and fresh fish?

Ikuyo: These days we sell a lot of vegetables. Amazing.

Rachel: Yeah, its hard to get those kind of vegetables anywhere else here. Like what?

Ikuyo: Daikon.

Yoshio: Daikon napa. And Shanghai.

Rachel: Is that Chinese cabbage?

Ikuyo: Yes.

Yoshio: Or green onion.

Ikuyo: Thai basil. Yeah. One of our customers just told me that we are the only ones selling Thai basil, fresh, here in D.C. We didnt know. No wonder they really go very fast.

Rachel: Yeah. So, you have a lot of items that people cant get anywhere else.

Ikuyo Tanabe: Yeah.

Yoshio: Many customers ask us where they can get sake. Unfortunately, in D.C., this area

Ikuyo: We dont have our liquor license. So, we cannot carry it right now.

Yoshio: In D.C., thats very difficult to get a license.

Rachel: So, what do you tell customers who ask where to get good sake?

Ikuyo: Theres one liquor store across the street from us. I told them to carry some sake, which they do now.

Rachel: You probably get them some good customers.

Ikuyo: They do.

Rachel: Whats the hardest part about running a small store?

Yoshio: I work seven days. I take off four days. We close only four days in a year.

Rachel: Four days in the year? Like, Christmas and?

Yoshio: Christmas, Thanksgiving, July 4, and Jan. 1. New Years.

Rachel: That is not very much. When do you leave the store?

Ikuyo: Around 9.

Yoshio: I try to go out by 9. But. Right, 9.

Rachel: Nine. And it opens at 10 again. So, youre probably there far before 10 in the morning.

Ikuyo: Well, between about 11:30 and 12.

Yoshio: Because I have to go to get things.

Rachel: So, youve grown a lot. You have a really loyal customers in D.C. and lots of people know you. Are you happy with how far its come?

Yoshio: No. Happy? At least not unhappy.

Rachel: Not unhappy. So, how did [Hana Market] start out?

Ikuyo: Hana has been always a grocery store.

Rachel: Right. But that the space where Hana is used to be?

Ikuyo: Oh, Japan Associates Travel. Thats the name of the travel agent.

Rachel: Ah. So, can you tell us how that started?

Ikuyo: Yes. I wanted to do something right after I quit my work at the embassy of Japan. In D.C. So, I started the Japanese travel agency.

Rachel: And what was your role?

Ikuyo: Well, I was the director. I am still. I run it now by myself. But I used to have three agents working for me.

Rachel: When did you open that?

Yoshio: 1983.

Ikuyo: A long time ago. Yeah.

Rachel: OK. But I understand that travel agents were not as much in need when the Internet came around.

Ikuyo: Yeah. Right, right. That was our biggest rival. And they worked seven days, you know, 24 hours. So.

Rachel: So, you needed to do something new. How did Hana Market come about?

Ikuyo: He wanted to do something after he ran a Japanese restaurant.

Rachel: And what restaurants did you work at?

Yoshio: The name is Japan Inn. Then the last two years, the same owner, they opened a new one, named Chez Mama-san. It was over there in Georgetown.

Rachel: How did the idea come about for a grocery store?

Yoshio: One of these companys staff asked me to open a restaurant.

But no, the restaurant business was too much. So. Then I just decided to do grocery. To open [a grocery] is much easier. So at that moment, I started by myself. Right? You know, first days since total?

Ikuyo: The first day that we opened that store.

Yoshio: Nov. 1 of 2008.

Rachel: What was that day like?

Yoshio: Do you know how much

Ikuyo: We made?

Rachel: No.

Yoshio: Guess it.

Rachel: $500?

Yoshio: Good.

Ikuyo: Pretty close.

Yoshio: Nowhere: $36.

Rachel: $36?

Ikuyo: Well, nobody knew Hana Market.

Yoshio: Yeah. I did it by myself too.

Ikuyo: He was the only one.

Yoshio: Right.

Rachel: $36. And how much do you make on an average day now?

Yoshio: That is secret. $100,000 a month.

Rachel: So, Hana Market has grown a lot since 2008. Do you know how people find out about Hana Market? Is it just word of mouth, or do you advertise a lot?

Ikuyo: We dont do advertising at all. Ive heard people say that there is a Yelp. Were on Yelp.

Rachel: Yes. You have good ratings on Yelp. But you dont do advertising yourself much?

Ikuyo: Uh-uh.

Yoshio: Because I dont like it.

Rachel: Why not?

Yoshio: That is Japanese custom. Especially restaurants. OK? High-class restaurants, they do not advertise.

Rachel: So, if its good enough, you dont need to advertise, because people hear about it.

Yoshio: Exactly. Yeah.

Rachel: How did you decide to turn the space into the grocery store and then keep the travel agency in the back?

Yoshio: We pushed her.

Ikuyo: Yeah, I got pushed in the corner.

Yoshio: At first, about two-thirds of the front is for grocery. Then we get more merchandise to put on the shelves.

Ikuyo: I would goyeah, [I got] pushed back.

Rachel: It was not by choice.

Ikuyo: No. But I dont need that much space. All I need is just one computer and one telephone. That little desk.

Rachel: Can you talk a little about how its changed?

Yoshio: The biggest change is the number of items. Because OK, I know that that is my personal problem, OK? When customers come ask me, I dont want to say no. OK?

I want to try it. And they ask, OK, can you get this? Then I check it. Then if I get it, if I can find it, then I keep it. So, thats why many are coming more and more and more. Right? One, two years later after we opened, there were 700 items.

After one year or two. Then a couple of years ago, we checked it. There are 1,700 [now].

Rachel: Yeah. You have so many different things. And yeah, a lot of different Asian items.

Yoshio: Even non-food.

Rachel: Non-food items.

Yoshio: Right. Like plate or something.

Ikuyo: Pot and pans, and then plates and dishes that are Chinese.

Ikuyo: I do those.

Yoshio: She cares about non-food stuff.

Ikuyo: Chopsticks.

Rachel: How about the Thai products, like tamarind sauce, things for making Thai dishes. Did someone ask you for those specifically?

Ikuyo: They did, right? Yeah. Especially those curry pastes. The green, red, yellow curry pastes.

Rachel: So, they just said?

Ikuyo: We carry those now.

Yoshio: When we opened it, we expected Japanese people. Right?

But after that, [everything was] so different than wed planed, than wed expected.

Ikuyo: Yeah. We have more not Japanese. More, you know, Americans and then another foreign nationalities. We have like 40 to 35 percent Japanese clients.

Yoshio: No. I think as a number, the number is about 20 percent.

Ikuyo: Twenty or 25 percent. They buy a lot. The volume is different.

Yoshio: About 40 percent almost. Almost a half. But the number of Japanese is, yeah, one-fifth.

Rachel: Wow. And thats surprising.

Ikuyo: Yeah. Most are American people.

Yoshio: Right. Many embassy people who lived in Japan, and those student who know Japanese food. Many, many non-Japanese people.

Ikuyo: With a lot of Chinese students.

Rachel: Yeah, yeah. So, you get people that miss Japanese food or miss Asian food that they remember.

Yoshio: So, thats why when I open it I get only Japanese food items. And now many different, Chinese or Korean, different things. We may have to change the name. Not Japanese grocery. We should have international grocery.

Ikuyo: We have to learn new things we dont know.

Rachel: Like what?

Ikuyo: Lots of Thai recipes that we do not know the names of the dishes.

Yoshio: Right. Cilantro, Thai basil.

Ikuyo: Now we carry all of those.

Yoshio: Lemongrass.

Ikuyo: Lemongrasses.

Yoshio: We didnt know that. What do they think theyre doing?

Ikuyo: We dont use those for Japanese cooking.

Yoshio: Like tamarind

Rachel: So, do you learn a lot of new recipes then?

Ikuyo: Yes.

Rachel: People ask you questions a lot about what you sell, right? So, do you know how to use all the products that you sell in a recipe?

Ikuyo: Not those non-Japanese ones. No.

Rachel: Right. But you got them because people wanted them.

Yeah. So, whats your favorite part of the day, Ikuyo?

Ikuyo: I dont know. Its not just a favorite part.

It doesnt happen every day. But many times, the special American people come to Hana Market with the recipes. And then they want me to help them to get those, and which I do. And then they say, well, Ill let you know how it comes out. And then after they come out the next day or a couple days later, they really come and they tell me how it turned out.

Thats really nice. I really like that moment.

Rachel: Oh, thats cool. Yeah. They feel like they have a relationship to you.

Ikuyo: Yeah. And especially since they are making this Japanese dish for the first time. And then theyre really serious about it. Its really nice to know. Yeah.

Rachel: Cool. Yeah. And the sushi making, I bet people do that a lot the first time. Do you cook a lot yourself?

Ikuyo: I do. I do. I love to. I love cooking. Yes.

Rachel: I imagine a lot of Japanese, since you have a lot.

Ikuyo: Yes. And then, we have a recipe, a sheet that you can take free. And then do like that. And then they buy the stuff on that page here.

Rachel: Oh, cool. What are you favorite dishes to make?

Ikuyo: I do, for my guests in my house, I do a do-it-yourself sushi, which is very easy.

All you have to do is just gather all the stuff, and then just show them how to do it. So, you make your own sushi. And everybody enjoys it, especially American people love that.

Rachel: And whats your favorite part of the day, Yoshio?

Yoshio: When customers ask, do you have like this? And I say, oh, we have that item. So, when they ask and we have it, yeah, Im very happy.

Then finally when they go out, they say, thank you. Thats another time Im very happy.

Gross: Yeah. When they cant get it anywhere else. Thank you so much for being on the show.

Ikuyo: Thank you.

Yoshio: Youre welcome.

Rachel: Thanks for talking to us.

Ikuyo: That was fun.

Rachel: Thanks for listening to Working. Im Rachel Gross. Wed love to hear your thoughts on the podcast. You can email us at working@slate.com. And you can listen to all five season at slate.com/working."
"149","Rams put franchise tag on cornerback Trumaine Johnson.txt",278,498,25,"Faced with the impending free agency of nearly the entire secondary, and equipped with the option to control at least one of the players, the Rams zeroed in on cornerback Trumaine Johnson and applied the nonexclusive franchise tag on him Tuesday.

The salary for cornerbacks who receive the nonexclusive franchise tag will be about $14 million this season. Teams and players with the tag have until July 15 to work out a long-term deal.

If Johnson signs with another team, the Rams would receive two No. 1 draft picks as compensation.

Johnson, 6 feet 2 and 208 pounds, intercepted seven passes in 2015. He played at Stockton Edison High and at Montana before the Rams chose him in the third round of the 2012 draft with the 65th overall pick.

He has started 33 games and has intercepted 14 passes, returning two for touchdowns.

Since we drafted Trumaine in 2012, he has developed into an integral part of our defense, General Manager Les Snead said in a statement. We look forward to having him with us this season and more to come.

Many players dislike the nonexclusive franchise tag. The one-year salary is no less than the average of the top five salaries at their position last season, but the tag prevents them from testing the open market and also can leave players at risk of injury without a guaranteed longer-term deal.

Johnson, 26, has played opposite Janoris Jenkins, 27, who is also among the Rams 12 unrestricted free agents. Jenkins also was regarded as a potential candidate to get the lone franchise tag. Jenkins fired his agent last weekend and, under NFL rules, must wait five days to hire a new one.

In a tweet that appeared to address his negotiations with the Rams, Jenkins on Sunday wrote: Total disrespect when u held down one side all 4 years and force the ball the other way.. #ThanksButNoThanks.

Agents for unrestricted free agents can begin negotiating, but contracts cant be signed, on March 7, the start of what is commonly referred to as legal tampering. The free-agency signing period begins March 9.

The Rams are about $60 million under the salary cap, which last week was set at $155.27 million.

The Rams cleared about $23 million in salary-cap space a few weeks ago when they released linebacker James Laurinaitis, defensive end Chris Long and tight end Jared Cook.

Snead and Coach Jeff Fisher have said that signing Johnson, Jenkins, safety Rodney McLeod and safety-linebacker Mark Barron was a top priority.

Defensive linemen William Hayes, Eugene Sims and Nick Fairley also are set to become unrestricted free agents.

Quarterback Case Keenum is among the teams restricted free agents, and the Rams are expected to tender an offer to keep him. If Keenum accepts an offer sheet from another team, the Rams would have the opportunity to match it and retain his services. If they lose him, the Rams could be granted one or more compensatory draft picks.

Colombian footballer James Rodriguez, 24, has been fined 10,400 ($11,300; 8,090) by the Spanish authorities for refusing to stop for police, Spanish media report.

The Real Madrid star was caught speeding on New Year's Day on his way to training, and refused to stop.

Police said he was driving at 200km/h (124mph), double the speed limit.

The fine is for refusing to stop when police told him to pull over. The fine for speeding has yet to be announced.

'Kidnap fear'

The incident happened on 1 January as Mr Rodriguez was driving in his Audi R8 on the M-40 motorway in the outskirts of Madrid.

Police in an unmarked vehicle caught the player speeding and hailed him over loudspeaker, telling him to pull over.

The player did not stop and was followed by the police car with a flashing siren all the way to the training ground.

The officers said Mr Rodriguez told them he did not stop because he feared they were trying to kidnap him.

Carjackings are not uncommon in his native Colombia but rather more rare in Spain.

He also said that he had not heard the siren because the music in his car had been too loud.

He has 15 days to appeal against the fine. But if he pays within the next two weeks, the sum due will be halved.

Big earner

The player earns 7.6m per year.

James Rodriguez is not the only current Real Madrid player to have been in trouble on the roads.

His team-mate Karim Benzema was caught driving at 195km/h (121mph) in February 2012.

He had his driving licence suspended for eight months and was fined 18,000 (14,012)."
"151","Rebecca Traisters All the Single Ladies, reviewed..txt",506,1090,46,"monkeybusinessimages/Thinkstock

Early in her new book All the Single Ladies, Rebecca Traister writes, The story of single women is the story of the country. Unmarried women, she argues, are a revolutionary force: Their very existence is changing our definitions of love, partnership, and family, and pushing our politics to the left. Women, writes Traister, perhaps especially those who have lived untethered from the energy-sucking and identity-sapping institution of marriage in its older forms, have helped to drive [the] social progress of this country since its founding. A writer-at-large for New York magazine and a contributing editor at Elle, Traister emphasizes that her goal is not to argue for one structure of life over another. Rather, she writes, The revolution is in the expansion of options, the lifting of the imperative that demanded early heterosexual marriage and motherhood.

Its been 15 years since HBOs Sex and the City delivered our most memorable send-up of the idea that feminism exists to pave the way for womens choices, whatever they may be. I choose my choice! I choose my choice! Charlotte shouts at Miranda, defending an embrace of domesticity that, as her friends predict, she will come to regret. We are still debating whether feminism should validate choice, or, specifically, the choices that push back against patriarchy. The enormous accomplishment of Traisters book is to show that the ranks of women electing for nontraditional livesincluding queer women, single mothers, proud spinsters, and women, including Traister herself, who forged their identities alone before marrying relatively latehave also improved the lots of women who make traditional choices, blowing open the institutions of marriage and parenthood.

No matter how much single women have done to remake society, the world is still set up primarily for couples.

Throughout All the Single Ladies, Traister demonstrates how one group of womens efforts to bend paradigms ended up improving the lives of another group. Because single women needed to workto support themselves and to ground their identities in something other than marriage and child-rearingthey normalized the image of the working woman, which benefited their married counterparts, too. Conversely, when married women with infertility pushed for medical help in making their families, they created a booming industry that is now helping women have children after marrying late or without a male partner. Traister even argues that single women are saving marriage in America. The idea of female choice, in Traisters book, is neither a platitude nor an apolitical evasion. Its an interconnected web of causes and effects thats remaking society for everyone.

Crucially, the books attentions dont fall disproportionately on single ladies who are white. It dives into the economic and social factors that have long made marriage less practicalor less possiblefor many women of color. From the racist distribution of New Deal benefits to suburban redlining to the growth of the carceral state, American policy has made it exponentially harder for many men of color to serve as stable partners and providers. Traister dismantles the popular conservative idea that a marriage cure is the best anti-poverty policy: Its not marriage itself, but the union of two incomes that makes legal coupledom a good bet. Traister writes, Its important to remember that, while poverty certainly makes single life harder, it also makes married life harder, so much harder that single life might be preferable. The book goes head-to-head with the pundits who treat singlehood, and especially single motherhood, as a form of failure or a scourge on society. It recasts a life alone as, for many people, a rational choice, and maybe not even a difficult one.

Some of the women in the book are not actually single in any strict sense. They fit into Traisters narrative because theyre structuring their lives in ways that convention-defying single women have made possible. In an early chapter, Traister writes about the historic figures who reshaped womens relationship to work by defining their lives around causes and creative passions, not husbands, including Susan B. Anthony and Mary Cassatt, who never married; as well as Zora Neale Hurston, Frida Kahlo, and Ida B. Wells, who spent long stretches single. When Traister tells the stories of contemporary women who are married to their jobs, however, she quotes many women who are married in the traditional sense as well. Traisters own mother told her, I love being everybodys grandmother and mother and wife and all of thatthats wonderful. But basically, theres got to be something thats me, and thats been my [working] life. Single women helped open the public sphere to all women, and helped edge marriage from its place at the undisputed center of womens lives.

Perhaps the boldest statement in the book is that single women are transforming marriage for the better. By demanding more from men and from marriage, its single women who have perhaps played as large a part as anyone in saving marriage in America, Traister writes. Its here that she shows most clearly how single women have initiated a domino effect that has flattened conventions all over the map of American life. The ability to delay marriage until a truly suitable mate came along, or to say no to connubial life altogether if the shoe didnt fit, has been womens primary source of leverage in the effort to make marriage more equitable, more supportive of womens personhood, and more free. Over time, womens changing demands have also altered mens desires: The book cites sociologist Kathleen Gersons research, which suggests that 80 percent of women and 70 percent of men desire egalitarian marriages in which wage earning, domestic duties, and childcare are divided equally. The latest step forward, Traister writes, is gay marriage, which reframes the power structure of the entire institution, disabling the gendered mechanism by which it historically exerted its oppressive power.

No matter how much single women have done to remake society, the world is still set upfrom tax codes to insurance policiesprimarily for couples. Traister closes her book with an appendix of policy proposals to improve the lot of single women; in accordance with her theme, most of these proposals would better the lives of women in general. Many boil down to fair pay, available sick and parental leave, and other things that would put men and women on equal economic footing, whether they are partnered or solo. We must not continue to function as if every worker has a wife caring for his home and his children for free, or as if every wife has a worker on whose paychecks she must depend, Traister writes."

i toggle caption Hansi Lo Wang/NPR Hansi Lo Wang/NPR

Whether or not you're a citizen in New York state, you have a right to attend a public high school and earn a diploma until you're 21. That was Pawsansoe Bree's plan after she left a refugee camp in Thailand when she was almost 19.

She resettled about four hours north of New York City  in the small, Rust Belt city of Utica, N.Y., which the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees once called ""The Town That Loves Refugees.""

Bree says she knew she had a lot of work to do when she arrived.

""I did not speak any English at all. I could barely say my name in English,"" says Bree, whose family fled Myanmar, also known as Burma, as refugees from the ethnic Karen community.

In Utica, Bree went to a newcomers program, where a teacher from the local school district taught English to young refugees like her. Eventually, the students asked to move on to Thomas R. Proctor High School, Utica's only high school.

""The teacher there told us, 'Oh, no, you cannot go to a high school,' "" Bree recalls. ""And we were like, 'Why?' And they told us, 'Oh, you are too old. You're 19 now, so by the time you're 21, you won't finish high school. You would just waste your time.' ""

'An Open Secret'

That conversation took place about eight years ago. Bree says since then, other district employees have given similar explanations to refugees who speak little or no English and want to go to high school. That's why she helped organize a group of students to sue the Utica City School District in federal court. Their class-action lawsuit, filed last April, says that for almost a decade, the district has discriminated against refugee students over 16, who are not required to go to school under New York state law.

""It was an open secret that refugees just knew within the community that once you were at a certain age and you're arriving in the country, you're just not going to get a chance to go to high school,"" says Phil Desgranges, an attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the students along with Legal Services of Central New York.

Desgranges says the district funneled his clients to alternative programs, mainly to learn English. While some students could attend GED classes, he claims none were given the choice to earn high school diplomas.

""They're putting them on a track where they can't become a doctor, where they can't become an engineer or a lawyer,"" he says. ""And that is absurd. That's the exact opposite of what our country's been built on, right?""

'Utica Needs To Get Its Fair Share'

NPR asked for an interview with the district's superintendent, Bruce Karam. His office directed requests to the district's attorney, who did not respond to multiple requests before publication.

But in a sworn statement filed in federal court, Karam says that the district has not ""denied enrollment to any eligible students based upon their age."" He is also asking a judge to dismiss a second, similar lawsuit filed by the New York state attorney general in November.

i toggle caption Hansi Lo Wang/NPR Hansi Lo Wang/NPR

""We want to be able to provide the sound basic education, which is guaranteed under the state constitution to all students, including our refugee population,"" Karam recently told Utica radio station WIBX. ""But in order to do this, the funding formula has got to be fixed, and Utica needs to get its fair share.""

Utica is one of New York's poorest school districts. It has faced hundreds of layoffs and regular budget deficits. In fact, it's involved in a separate lawsuit that says public schools in Utica and other small cities in New York have suffered from underfunding by the state.

'The Children Have A Right To Study'

Still, the state attorney general's office argues that Utica is breaking federal funding rules by discriminating against immigrant students. Justin Deabler, an assistant attorney general for New York, adds that problems enrolling immigrants in schools have grown since the recent surge of unaccompanied children from Central America.

""The settlements that our office has reached have spanned northern, western New York, southern New York,"" he says. ""We see these problems cropping up all over New York state, not simply in Utica.""

More than 20 school districts have settled with New York's attorney general's office, which announced its latest agreement on Monday after an investigation found that the Westbury Union Free School District on Long Island was excluding immigrants over 16 from high school.

Deabler says Utica is the first school district the state has taken to court on this issue.

It's also the first district Patrick Tuyizere, 19, has ever sued. He's one of the refugee students who filed the class-action lawsuit claiming the district prevented them from going to high school.

But now Tuyizere leaves his family's apartment most mornings with a backpack strapped on. After he filed the lawsuit, the district contacted him about enrolling at Proctor High School, which he and four other refugee students in the suit recently started attending.

""We have a right to be in class to study. The children have a right to study,"" says Tuyizere, who was born in a refugee camp in Rwanda after his family fled from violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Both cases against the Utica City School District are still ongoing. Tuyizere's attorneys say they want to make sure other refugees can go to high school  even if they don't have lawyers backing them up."
"154","Rights groups accuse France of brutality in Calais eviction.txt",314,572,26,"CALAIS, France (AP)  More than a dozen humanitarian organizations on Tuesday accused authorities of brutally evicting migrants from their makeshift dwellings in a sprawling camp in northern France, as fiery protests of the demolition continued.

Thousands of migrants fleeing war and misery in their homelands use the port city of Calais as a springboard to try to get to Britain on the other side of the English Channel. However, authorities are moving to cut short that dream by closing a large swath of the slum camp in the port city of Calais.

In the stinging accusation at the close of the second day of a state-ordered mass eviction and demolition operation, the organizations charged that authorities have failed to respect their promise of a humane and progressive operation based on persuading migrants to vacate their tents and tarp-covered homes.

""Refugees, under threats and disinformation, were given one hour to 10 minutes to leave their homes,"" a statement said. Police pulled out some who refused, making arrests in certain cases, while others were not allowed to gather their belongings or identity papers, the statement charged.

Migrants and pro-migrant activists protested against the eviction Tuesday, some climbing onto shanty rooftops to briefly stall the tear-down, and others by starting a night fire. Tents and tarp-covered lean-tos were also set afire on Monday and earlier Tuesday.

The protesting organizations alleged that police aimed flash-balls at the roof protesters, then clubbed them and made some arrests.

View gallery French riot police officers walk past a burning dwelling in a makeshift migrants camp near Calais, F 

Tear gas, water cannons and other tactics have been used excessively, the statement charged.

Organizations respected for their humanitarian work with migrants, such as Auberge des Migrants (Migrants' Shelter), GISTI and Secours Catholique were among the 14 who signed the list of charges.

The mass evictions from the southern sector of the camp were announced Feb. 12 with promises by Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve that there would be no brutality. However, the Monday start of operations came as a surprise.

The regional prefecture in charge of the demolition says the hundreds of police present are needed to protect workers in the tear-down and state employees advising migrants of their options.

France's government has offered to relocate uprooted migrants into heated containers nearby or to centers around France where they can decide whether to apply for asylum. Officials have blamed activists from the group No Borders for the ongoing unrest. But many migrants resist French offers of help, afraid of hurting their chances of reaching Britain.

Officials say the evictions concern 800-1,000 migrants, but organizations working in the camp say the real number is more than 3,000.

A court has ordered that common places like houses of worship, schools and a library that have sprung up must not be destroyed.

The city bordering the Channel has ferry links and the Eurotunnel rail to England, and is temporary home to an estimated 4,000 migrants, down from 6,000 in December. The camp has become a flashpoint between France and Britain, fueling far-right support in both countries.

""This operation will continue in coming days, calmly and methodically, providing a place for everyone as the government has committed,"" French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said in a statement Tuesday.

The former head of the UN climate change panel (IPCC), Rajendra Pachauri, has been formally charged in an Indian court in a case of sexual harassment.

A female employee at the environmental think-tank The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) had accused him last year of harassment.

Accusations by a second employee last month caused widespread outrage.

Mr Pachauri, who has denied the allegations against him, stepped down from the UN panel last year.

In February, he was forced to go on indefinite leave by Teri after the latest accusations.

On Tuesday, charges running into more than 1,400 pages were filed in the court of metropolitan magistrate Shivani Chauhan in Delhi, the Press Trust of India reported.

Mr Pachauri has been accused of sexual harassment, stalking and criminal intimidation, the agency said.

The charges relate to accusations made by the first woman. The magistrate has said she will hear the case on 23 April.

Mr Pachauri collected the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 on behalf of the IPCC for its work in the scientific assessment of the risks and causes of climate change.

The IPCC shared the award with former US vice-president and environmental campaigner, Al Gore."

The Rolling Stones have announced they are to give a free concert in Cuba later this month.

A band spokesman said the show in the capital Havana on 25 March was ""the first open air concert in Cuba by a British rock band"".

The Stones are currently on a Latin American tour due to end on 17 March in Mexico City.

The Havana gig will come three days after an historic visit to Cuba by US President Barack Obama.

In a statement, The Rolling Stones said: ""We have performed in many special places during our long career, but this show in Havana is going to be a landmark event for us, and, we hope, for all our friends in Cuba too.""

Image copyright Twitter Image caption The band announced the show on Twitter

Rock music was marginalised in Cuba for political reasons after the Cuban revolution in the 1950s which saw Fidel Castro come to power.

In 2001, Manic Street Preachers became the biggest British rock band to play in the country, putting on a show at Havana's Karl Marx Theatre which was attended by the Cuban president.

The Stones' America Latina Ole tour also includes shows in Brazil, Peru and Colombia.

The Havana gig will be filmed by director Paul Dugdale, who has previously worked with One Direction, Adele and Coldplay."

Havana will meet the Rolling Stones later this month.

The band has announced they'll play a free open-air concert in the Cuban capital on March 25.

That will make them ""the most famous act to play Cuba since its 1959 revolution,"" the Associated Press reports.

""We have performed in many special places during our long career but this show in Havana is going to be a landmark event for us, and, we hope, for all our friends in Cuba too,"" the Rolling Stones said in a statement. They're currently on tour in South and Central America.

The concert is scheduled just three days after President Obama is set to visit Cuba. He'll be the first sitting U.S. president since Calvin Coolidge to do so, as The Two-Way has reported.

Cuba has a fraught history with rock and roll. NPR's alt.latino explains:

""Fidel Castro didn't like rock music. Or hippies. In 1968, he launched a 'revolutionary offensive' aimed at eliminating all remnants of capitalism. He also closed Havana's nightclubs for a year. ""Castro aimed to cure Cuba once and for all of 'ideological deviants,' which included long-haired youth, homosexuals and any others the authorities simply had reason to mistrust. For Cuban authorities, The Beatles were viewed as harbingers of an imperialist offensive out to corrupt young Cuban minds. ""Over the next two years, thousands of youth were swept up in a repressive crackdown.""

But as NPR's Carrie Kahn reported to our Newscast unit, ""Castro later repented when he dedicated a statue of John Lennon in a Havana park in 2000.""

She adds: ""Since warming relations with the U.S. more than a year ago, Cuba has been visited extensively by U.S. entertainers, artists and business leaders.""

The Rolling Stones were becoming global stars at the height of Cuba's crackdown.

""It's part of a dream to see the greatest icons of music who couldn't come before for various reasons, above all Cuba's isolation,"" Cuban music critic Joaquin Borges Triana tells the Associated Press. ""The Rolling Stones are going to magically unite generations of Cubans, from people in their 60s to their children and grandchildren."""

In 1972, when she was still an unknown photographer, Rosalind Fox Solomon presented Alice Walker, then a part-time editor for Ms. magazine, with a box of her doll photographs, images of cracked porcelain faces presented in the manner of human portraits, and cotton-stuffed bodies contorted on floral linensa universal symbol, profoundly disrupted. As Fox Solomon, who is now eighty-five, tells it, Walker gasped upon seeing the pictures, and said that they recalled the murders of civil-rights leaders. The photographer was taken aback by the comparison at the time, but from our current vantage it isnt difficult to connect the doll images with what Walker saw. Though personal preoccupations inspired Fox Solomons creationsshe says that she was, in that period, consumed by thoughts of her husbands incurable illnessher pictures held more than the artists intentions.

Fox Solomons photographscomposed in the black-and-white square format also employed in the work of Diane Arbusare often described as personal. And while some of her work is explicitly so, in the sense of self-facingher 2008 exhibition, Inside Out, for instance, featured nude self-portraits accompanied by excerpts from her private journalsthis evaluation more often stems from the intimate acquaintance Fox Solomon offers with characters and subjects far and wide. The photographs for which she is best known, such as her unsparing portraits of people living with AIDS, taken at the height of the epidemic in the U.S., demonstrate a decidedly outward view. And though Fox Solomon has many times depicted locations and eras that would lend themselves to expressly political workNorth Ireland and Yugoslavia in times of ethnic violence, Peru during the terror of the Shining Path, South Africa under apartheidher pictures remain human-scaled and emotionally rooted.

Fox Solomons new book, Got to Go, is personal by both definitions. The collections subject matter is quite diffuse, with photographs shot over three decades, in the United States and twenty foreign countries. They are presented in what could be called a Home vs. Away structurealternating between scenes that would seem to resemble the life Fox Solomon was born into (Western, white, materially comfortable) and ones that are suffused with tribal exoticism, third-world deprivations and joys, and inhabited by others, each charged with a precise empathy. But the book as a whole is, by and large, about the photographer herself, owing to a running text accompanying the images, which tells, in poetic vignettes, of Fox Solomons unhappy childhood, and flows from page to page in a type of chronology, forming a rather insistent narrative and emotional spine for the work, a prescribed path for understanding: mother says WIPE THAT SMILE OFF YOUR FACE; father is having an affair. The text plays off both sets of images, exposing polished American family life, embodied by Fox Solomons parents, as violently false, broken by the weight of its regulated appearances and claustrophobic limits, and emphasizing its undue burden on women and girls.

On occasion, particularly in relation to the images of foreign people in foreign lands, this structure seems to approach the line between empathy and projection, where the personal threatens to become an imposition. In one such instance, Fox Solomons text, at the bottom of an otherwise blank white page, reads, they call me piggy / i eat / brown sugar and whipped cream / nothing fills my emptiness. On the opposing page, a young girl stands in rubble, on a hill above a Bedouin camp in Israel. Her white, diaphanous dress is dirtied. She has no shoes, her skin is spotted with soot, and her face, below the nose, appears to be marked with blood. Fox Solomons remembered pain makes no fair parallel with the suffering here seen and implied. But the words also cannot mar the power of the photograph, which glows with white desert light, and the beauty of the girl, who, in this permanent instant, stands with feet apart, solid in her gown-like garb, regal and knowing as any child may be. The picture, like many others in the collection, is too immense to be hindered by any ill-fitting frame, and contains much more than any singular design.

Former Deputy Scott Neu, who was fired last year, was charged with felony counts of assault and making criminal threats and misdemeanor charges of cruelty to a prisoner and failure to perform an official duty. Neu faces a maximum of 10 years and two months in prison if hes found guilty.

Deputy Eugene Jones was charged with felony counts of directing the assaults and with misdemeanors of failing to perform an official duty. If convicted, he faces five years behind bars. Jones was put on unpaid administrative leave Tuesday, a sheriffs spokeswoman said.

Deputy Clifford Chiba, who is reported to have given an inmate fight tips, was charged with misdemeanor counts of cruel punishment of a prisoner and failure to perform an official duty. Chiba faces 1 1/2 years behind bars. The spokeswoman said Chiba is working at a post that does not involve contact with the public or inmates.

The charges stemmed from an investigation by the San Francisco Public Corruption Task Force, which was created by Gascon and the FBI.

San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi revealed the jailhouse fights last year. He said it appeared that deputies had been betting on the inmate fighters. One of the inmates was forced to fight a much larger man and feared for his safety, Adachi said.

Sheriff Vicki Hennessy, who took office in January, said she hopes to purchase body cameras for deputies in the Hall of Justice jail, which typically houses 300 inmates.

The jail is older and rectangular in shape with cells divided by a hallway. Over time, the stationary cameras in the jail had stopped working, and there was not enough money to replace them, she said. Hennessy said the department will soon do that.

She said she did not expect any more deputies to be charged.

This is something that is embarrassing for the deputies, of course, because most them are professional, hardworking and humane people who do their job in very difficult circumstances, she said.

Hennessy defeated former Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi in November. Since taking over, she said, she has required performance evaluations and more training.

We have to hold people accountable and put a system in place that does hold people accountable, she said.

It was Schuerrle's cross at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana which saw Mario Goetze score Germany's winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final.

But the 25-year-old Schuerrle has struggled to hold down a first-team place since joining Wolfsburg from Chelsea a year ago.

""I already have the match ball in the changing room,"" beamed Schuerrle as Wolfsburg got back to winning ways after Saturday's 2-0 defeat at home to Bayern Munich.

""I was playing more as a striker tonight and the change paid off. Of course I'm pleased, but it's the sort of game which is good for the soul.""

March 1 is a lucky day for Schuerrle who also scored a hat-trick for Chelsea against Fulham in the Premier League exactly two years ago.

His performance will boost his standing at Wolfsburg and in this one game he has scored more goals than in his previous 33 matches for the Champions League side.

He needed just 26 minutes to score three goals before Germany team-mate Julian Draxler added Wolfsburg's fourth at Hanover's HDI Arena.

View gallery French striker Anthony Modeste, pictured on October 4, 2015, rescued a point for Cologne in their 1- 

Schuerrle opened the scoring by firing home Draxler's pass in off the post on 36 minutes.

He doubled his tally on 59 minutes and then claimed his third less than three minutes later when he chested the ball down and fired home with a superb shot.

He could have finished with four goals after his chip went just wide of the post before Draxler netted Wolfsburg's fourth on 69 minutes.

The win leaves Wolfsburg eighth while Hanover are bottom and six points from safety.

The German FA (DFB) is expected to fine both clubs after one of the flares fired from the away fan block hit the Hanover bench before kick-off, but no-one was hurt.

""That sort of thing shouldn't happen in a stadium,"" said Schuerrle in criticising the fans' behaviour.

This is not the first time this fixture has been affected by fireworks.

In December 2014, Wolfsburg fans also fired four flares and set off a smoke bomb in the away section of Hanover's stadium.

Both clubs were fined 6,000 euros ($6,500) at the time.

""There is already some history of this happening and there should be no place for it in football,"" said Hanover captain Christian Schulz.

Elsewhere, French striker Anthony Modeste rescued a point for Cologne in their 1-1 draw at Ingolstadt after forward Lukas Hinterseer had given the hosts the lead.

"164","Scientists Find A Gene That Turns Hair Gray _ Shots.txt",218,379,28,"This Gene Could Turn Your Hair Gray

i toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto

We all know ancestors give us our hair color, but the roots of gray hair have been less clear. Is it genetics, or stress?

Marie Antoinette supposedly went completely white the night before they lopped off her head. And our presidents seem to go gray much faster than those of us with less weighty roles.

It turns out you can blame Mom and Dad, at least a bit. Scientists say they've identified the first gene for gray hair.

The variant, dubbed IRF4, is also associated with blonde or lighter-colored hair. That makes sense, because melanin is the pigment that paints hair with the chestnut, golden or raven hues of youth. With age, the melanocytes that produce the color in hair follicles can slow down. And you start going gray.

""You think about hair graying as the absence of melanin,"" says Kaustubh Adhikari, a statistical genetics postdoc at University College London and lead author of the study, which was published Tuesday in Nature Communications.

Gray hair is more common in people of European origin, as is lighter hair. That makes sense, Adhikari says. ""You would sort of think of hair graying as an unintended consequence of selecting for this hair color."" In other words, if you decide to marry a blonde, don't be surprised if your kids someday turn gray.

People of Asian and African ancestry also go gray, but less often than do Europeans. ""You would expect that they would have genes that influence graying,"" Adhikari says. ""We just haven't found them yet.""

The scientists discovered the gray gene by studying the scalps and facial hair of 6,630 volunteers in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru. The researchers took photographs and asked about natural hair color. The participants had a mix of European, Native American and African ancestry.

Then the scientists performed genetic analyses called genome-wide association scans that look for common variants, and matched them with appearance.

Ten new variants popped out; gray hair was matched with one. Others influence unibrow, balding, eyebrow thickness and hair structure.

Still, genetics isn't necessarily destiny. Adhikari figures that the IRF4 variant accounts for about 30 percent of gray hair, with environmental factors  including, perhaps, stress  accounting for the rest."
"165","Scott Kelly heads home after nearly a year in space.txt",281,509,26,"Washington (AFP) - After nearly a year orbiting the Earth, US astronaut Scott Kelly was on the cusp of coming home Tuesday after spending more time in space than any other American.

The 52-year-old is due to leave the International Space Station after 340 days together with his colleague Mikhail Kornienko and catch a ride back to Earth on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.

""Physically, I feel pretty good,"" a slightly wistful Kelly told reporters via video link just days ago.

""I could go another 100 days,"" he said. ""I could go another year if I had to.""

Following a farewell ceremony, Kelly and Kornienko, who is Russian, are scheduled to enter the Soyuz capsule docked with the ISS around 2100 GMT.

They are set to undock several hours later, at 0105 GMT Wednesday.

View gallery This NASA image released December 22, 2015 shows Expedition 46 Commander Scott Kelly on a December 2 

The Soyuz will then orbit the Earth and about two hours later it will begin its 53-minute plunge.

The men are expected to land in the steppes of Kazakhstan at 0427 GMT Wednesday.

Kelly and Kornienko, 55, arrived at the ISS on March 27, 2015.

Their mission has been part of an effort to study the physiological effects of long-term space travel on the human body.

They have been subjected to a battery of tests and other experiments in preparation for a future manned mission to Mars and beyond.

Kelly's identical twin brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, has been participating on the ground, providing comparisons that will help study how space changes humans.

Weightlessness reduces muscle mass and bone density and is believed to diminish eyesight by increasing cerebrospinal fluid around the optic nerve.

Command of the ISS will pass from Kelly to his fellow American astronaut Tim Kopra as soon as the Soyuz undocks from the space station, marking the beginning of a new mission, expedition 47.

- ""Like camping"" -

Besides human contact with family and friends, Kelly said, he misses the earthly pleasure of a shower.

In the absence of gravity, drops of water float in the air and stick to the skin upon contact.

Astronauts must instead wash with wet towelettes and use a toilet equipped with a suction tube.

""It's kind of like I've been in the woods camping for a year,"" he told reporters.

Kelly and Kornienko have logged the longest stay on the ISS since the first astronaut arrived in 2000.

However, the record for the longest single spaceflight is held by Russian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, who spent more than 437 consecutive days aboard the Mir space station in the mid-1990s.

In addition to breaking the record of uninterrupted time in space for an American, Kelly will also have logged 520 cumulative days in space over four flights, surpassing the previous record of 382 days by astronaut Mike Fincke.

Russia's Gennady Padalka holds the world record for total time spent in space with 879 days."
"166","Seventeen Stories to Read This Super Tuesday.txt",301,528,24,"Today, voters in a dozen states and one U.S. territory go to the polls to help choose the Republican and Democratic Presidential nominees. It will be a consequential day for all seven of the major candidates; more than half of the G.O.P.s convention delegates are at stake, along with more than a third of the Democrats. Here are some of the New Yorker stories worth reading as the results begin to trickle in.

For Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, winning the minority vote is critical. Amy Davidson wrote about where both candidates stand in the February 22nd issue of the magazine. She has also written about the lessons from last Thursdays screamfest between Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, as well as Jeb Bushs befuddled exit from the campaign. Even when, or if, the nomination is set, the soul of the Republican Party is likely to remain in limbo for a while, Davidson notes.

John Cassidy recently examined Donald Trumps business record, including his decision to delay the release of his tax returns, and the effect of his populist, nativist political rhetoric on the G.O.P. The Republican primary race has turned into a demolition derby, Cassidy writes. On the Democratic side, he argues that Clintons victory in South Carolina this past weekend has helped her regain her aura of inevitability.

Trumps hostile takeover of the Republican Party has put many conservatives in an awkward position, Ryan Lizza writes, Not backing Trump is one thing, but many anti-Trump Republicans may soon have to grapple with the question of whether they may actually need to support Clinton. And how will Trump fare against Ted Cruz, who is approaching the G.O.P. primary from what Lizza calls a sharply different angle?

Evan Osnos wrote recently about Trumps white-nationalist supporters, including a former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. To inhabit Trumps landscape for a while, to chase his jet or stay behind with his fans in a half-dozen states, is to encounter a confederacy of the frustrated, Osnos writes. But if Trump has won success by being an opinionated firebrand, Marco Rubio has taken the opposite tack. Rubio has succeeded in politics by straddling as many positions as possible, Osnos writes in his Profile of the Florida senator.

Last year, Kelefa Sanneh wrote about the G.O.P.s unlikeliest 2016 candidate, Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon. Perhaps sober, lite-approved Presidential candidates, seasoned by decades of political experience, will come to seem as old-fashioned as network news anchors, and for some of the same reasons, Sanneh writes. And perhaps a candidate like Trump is the logical replacement; Sanneh traced Trumps early success to his inflammatory comments about immigration.

Each of the leading Republican candidates has captured a different sentiment, Benjamin Wallace-Wells writes. The crowds at each of their rallies have a different feeling: Trumps are like arena rock concerts, Cruzs like school-board meetings, Rubios like management-consulting recruitment seminars. But why havent the Cruz and Rubio campaigns done a better job of attacking Trump? And whats left for a candidate like John Kasich, a vestige of the fading Republican establishment? Super Tuesday may answer a few of these questions, even if it brings up many more."

"168","Shell being sued in two claims over oil spills in Nigeria.txt",321,684,34,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The local fishing community in Nigeria's delta region have been hardest hit by recent oil spills

Oil giant Shell is being sued in London for the second time in five years over spills in the Niger Delta.

Two communities are claiming compensation and want Shell to clean up their land.

Shell said it is at an ""early stage"" in reviewing the claims and that the case should be heard in Nigeria.

The Ogale community of about 40,000 people in Rivers State, on the coast of Nigeria, who are mainly farmers or fishermen, are some of the claimants.

Their case is being handled by law firm Leigh Day.

Spills since 1989 have meant they don't have clean drinking water, farmland or rivers, their claim says.

It points to a November 2015 report by Amnesty International which says four spill sites Shell says it planned to clean up are still contaminated.

The first court hearing at the Technology and Construction Court, held on Wednesday, found that the claimants can can lodge a case against Shell's Nigerian business, known as Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC). Shell declined to comment on the ruling.

Clean-up plan

Amnesty's findings followed a 2011 report by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which found water contaminated with oil by-products including benzene, thought to be a carcinogen. It suggested a clean up, but said a ""sustainable recovery"" of the area could take up to 30 years.

Shell says it has agreed a clean-up plan.

""In mid-2015 SPDC JV, along with the government, UNEP and representatives of the Ogoni community, agreed to an 18-month roadmap to fast-track the environmental clean-up and remediation of Ogoniland which includes a governance framework,"" it said in a statement.

The Bille community, who are mainly fishermen and are the other party to sue, claims Shell should be liable for ""failing to protect their pipelines from damage caused by third parties"", according to Leigh Day.

Theft

Pipelines in the area have been targets for thieves who steal crude oil and try to refine it locally. This has lead to more spills and damage though explosions.

""Both Bille and Ogale are areas heavily impacted by crude oil theft, pipeline sabotage and illegal refining which remain the main sources of pollution across the Niger Delta.

""Ogale is in Ogoniland and it is important to note that SPDC has produced no oil or gas in Ogoniland since 1993. Access to the area has been limited following a rise in violence, threats to staff and attacks on facilities,"" Shell said.

Settlement

But the communities say Shell pipelines lack the technology to detect and shut off leaks, whatever the cause.

Daniel Leader, partner at Leigh Day said: ""It is scandalous that four years after the UNEP Report Shell is yet to clean up its oil in either Ogale or Bille. Our client's patience has now run out and we intend to force Shell to act since it is clear they have no intention of doing so on their own.""

In January last year, Shell agreed to an $84m (55m) settlement with residents of the Bodo community in the Niger Delta for two oil spills.

The same law firm, Leigh Day, said their 15,600 clients would receive $3,300 each for losses caused by the spills.

The remaining $30m would be left for the community, which Leigh Day said was ""devastated by the two massive oil spills in 2008 and 2009"".

That dispute began in 2011.

Image copyright bbc

During the trial emails, letters and internal reports submitted to a court in London, and seen by the BBC, showed that senior Shell employees were concerned before the spill that Shell's pipelines in the area had reached the end of their lives and needed replacing to avoid danger to lives, the environment and the economy.

Two spills in 2008 affected about 35 sq miles (90 sq km) in southern Nigeria, according to the Bodo community which sued Shell.

Shell said at the time it ""dismisses the suggestion that it has knowingly continued to use a pipeline that is not safe to operate""."

New York Times columnist Ross Douthat argued on Sunday that Donald Trumps rise in the Republican primaries is due in part to Obama-era trends in liberal politics. Will Saletan rejects that argument. Obama didnt cause Trump, Saletan writes. What caused Trump was the GOPs decision to negate Obama in every way, and thereby become the party of Trump.

South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has survived a no-confidence in parliament, while a court is hearing a case to reinstate 738 corruption charges against him.

Governing party MPs defeated the motion by a big margin, while Mr Zuma's office said he would oppose the court case.

The opposition was behind both actions, accusing him of taking a bribe.

Mr Zuma has denied the allegation, linked to a multi-billion dollar arms deal negotiated over a decade ago.

He was first charged in 2005, and fired as deputy president by then-President Thabo Mbeki.

After much legal and political wrangling, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) dropped the case in April 2009, and Mr Zuma went on to become president a month later.

During a noisy parliamentary session, DA leader Mmusi Maimane described Mr Zuma as a sell-out whose main aim was self-enrichment.

South Africa was ""spiralling downward, and doing so at an alarmingly fast rate"" under his presidency, the party added in a statement.

'Spy tapes'

The governing African National Congress (ANC) party said that despite the ""frivolous antics"" of the DA, its confidence in Mr Zuma remained unshaken.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Maimane says Mr Zuma is a ""sell out""

The motion was defeated by 225 votes to 99, with 22 abstentions.

In the High Court, the DA's lawyers said the decision of the NPA to drop the corruption charges was unconstitutional and irrational.

Mr Zuma's office said, in a statement, that the court action was an ""abuse of process by a political party in order to advance a political agenda"".

The president was confident that the NPA's decision would ""withstand any scrutiny"", the statement added.

At the time, the NPA said phone-tap evidence, dubbed in the local media as ""spy tapes"", suggested political interference in the investigation, and it was ""unconscionable"" to press ahead with the case.

Chicken run

The DA brought the case after it won a lengthy battle in 2014 to obtain the ""spy tapes"".

Mr Zuma, a former ANC intelligence chief, has been dogged by controversy throughout his time in government.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The government used some $23m (15m) of state money to upgrade Mr Zuma's Nkandla home

Last month, he conceded in court that he needed to pay the government for money used to upgrade his private home, which included the building of a swimming pool, amphitheatre, chicken run and cattle enclosure.

That case was brought by the DA and left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party after Mr Zuma failed to pay the money, despite a ruling against him by an independent anti-corruption body in 2014.

In December, South Africa's currency went into a tail spin after having three finance ministers in a week.

i toggle caption James Nord/AP James Nord/AP

Gov. Dennis Daugaard has vetoed a bill that would have required transgender students in South Dakota's public schools to use bathrooms, locker rooms and other facilities based on their gender at birth.

Daugaard issued the veto Tuesday afternoon on a bill that would have become law at midnight if he had taken no action.

Opponents of the measure, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Human Rights Campaign, had called on Daugaard to veto the bill.

""Proponents of House Bill 1008 say it protects students' privacy,"" South Dakota Public Radio reports. ""Opponents say it's discrimination.""

After the bill was approved by a 20-15 vote in the state Senate last month, its opponents held protests and questioned lawmakers about it. Daugaard, who in the past had said that he saw the legislation as providing accommodations for both sides, had also met with transgender students and parents.

""I heard their personal stories,"" Daugaard said after those meetings, according to SDPB. ""And so I saw things through their eyes in that sense. I had read other personal stories. Certainly I'm getting personal stories through the emails, and through what I read in the paper.""

The law would have had particular impact for the 1,360 youth in South Dakota who identify as transgender, according to an estimate by the Williams Institute, a think tank based at UCLA. But it's also part of a wider debate over lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.

Last week, the city council of Charlotte, N.C., approved a nondiscrimination ordinance that allows transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice.

According to the ACLU, at least 200 other cities and counties have enacted similar legislation, as have at least 18 states."
"174","South Dakota governor vetoes law on transgender bathrooms.txt",379,753,42,"PIERRE, S.D. (AP)  South Dakota's governor vetoed a bill Tuesday that would have made the state the first in the U.S. to approve a law requiring transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their sex at birth.

Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard, who initially reacted positively to the proposal but said he needed to research the issue, rejected the bill after groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Human Rights Campaign insisted it was discriminatory.

In his veto message, Daugaard said the bill ""does not address any pressing issue"" and that such decisions were best left to local school officials. He also noted that signing the bill could create costly liability issues for schools and the state. The ACLU had promised to encourage legal action if the bill became law.

""I am so happy right now. You have no idea,"" said 18-year-old Thomas Lewis, a transgender high school student in Sioux Falls. Lewis said he has support at his school, but that the veto shows such support goes beyond his friends.

""The government's not going to hold me back from who I really am,"" he said.

The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Fred Deutsch, said he would ask lawmakers not to override the veto, saying more focus on the issue would detract from the Legislature's accomplishment this year. The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the bill last month, with supporters saying it would protect student privacy.

Transgender rights have become a new flashpoint in the nation's cultural clashes following the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage last year. The high court victory encouraged advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights to push harder, prompting backlash from conservatives.

Caitlyn Jenner, the transgender activist and former Olympic decathlon gold medalist, had called on Daugaard to veto the bill. Opponents also used the South Dakota Tourism Department's Twitter hashtag to take aim at the state's roughly $3.8 billion tourism industry.

Other high-profile cases include last week's vote in North Carolina by the Charlotte City Council to allow transgender people to choose a bathroom. The vote was immediately criticized by Gov. Pat McCrory, who said it denied privacy rights for those who expect to share restrooms or locker rooms only with people born with the same anatomy.

In Texas, Houston voters soundly defeated an ordinance that would have banned discrimination against transgender people after opponents alleged it would allow sexual predators to go into women's bathrooms.

Daugaard initially offered a positive reaction to South Dakota's proposal, but said he wanted to listen to testimony before making a decision. Last week, he met with three transgender individuals and heard their personal stories; before the meeting, the governor said he had never knowingly met a transgender person.

Opponents said the legislation was an attack on vulnerable transgender students that would further marginalize them at school. They also criticized comments made by some lawmakers, including Republican Sen. David Omdahl.

""I'm sorry if you're so twisted you don't know who you are,"" Omdahl said when asked about the bill last month. ""I'm telling you right now, it's about protecting the kids, and I don't even understand where our society is these days.""

Under the plan, schools would have been required to provide a ""reasonable accommodation"" for transgender students, such as a single-occupancy bathroom or the ""controlled use"" of a staff-designated restroom, locker room or shower room.

Supporters said the proposal was a response to changes in President Barack Obama administration's interpretation of the federal Title IX anti-discrimination law related to education. Federal officials have said barring students from restrooms that match their gender identity is prohibited under Title IX.

Deutsch had said the plan pushed back ""against federal overreach and intrusion into our lives.""

Heather Smith, executive director of the ACLU of South Dakota, said Tuesday that had the governor signed the bill, schools would have been forced to choose whether follow state or federal law. She also said her organization would have encouraged any student harmed by the new law to file a federal civil rights complaint.

Smith said people from across the state and country reached out to the governor to urge this veto. She said that's the true testament of democracy.

Chad Griffin, president of the Human Right Campaign, added that the governor ""chose to do the right thing.""

""Today, the voices of fairness and equality prevailed, and these students' rights and dignity prevailed against overwhelming odds and vicious opponents in the state Legislature,"" Griffin said.

"175","Spain election_ Socialist Sanchez pleads to become PM.txt",213,443,25,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pedro Sanchez urged parliament to form a government for change

Spain's Socialist party leader, Pedro Sanchez, has urged deputies to back his bid to form a coalition government.

But his attempt to end 11 weeks of political deadlock since inconclusive elections seems likely to fail, correspondents say.

Between them, the Socialists (PSOE) and partner party Ciudadanos command only 130 seats in the 350-seat lower chamber of parliament.

The two other main parties have said they will not support Mr Sanchez.

In his address to parliament on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Sanchez called for the formation of a coalition based on common interests.

""Why don't we form a government based on those things that bring the majority of the 350 deputies of this parliament together?"" he asked.

""Why don't we unite to form a government for change? Why don't we get together and pass as many reforms as possible to solve the most urgent problems of Spaniards? Why don't we vote together in favour of all issues in which we are in agreement?""

Strain of Sanchez's bid to rule

Podemos bangs on doors of power

Mr Sanchez warned that time was running out for a decision.

""We have two options. Either we do nothing and allow [conservative leader Mariano] Rajoy to continue presiding over the interim government, or we opt for a change based on dialogue and agreements. There are only two options and this chamber has to decide what to do - either we stay still or we start walking.""

A confidence vote will be held on Wednesday at which Mr Sanchez will need to gain the support of more than half of the chamber's 350 seats to be voted in as prime minister.

Failing that, another vote will be held on Friday at which he would require only more votes in favour than against.

Given that opponents Podemos and the Popular Party have 191 seats between them, at the very least he would need significant numbers of their deputies to abstain. But Podemos and smaller parties rejected overtures from Mr Sanchez's PSOE earlier in the week.

If he succeeds in neither vote, parliament will have two months to choose a government or face fresh elections on 26 June.

The incumbent Popular Party gained most votes in the 20 December election but its leader, Mr Rajoy, was unable to secure enough backing to form a government.

The PSOE performed badly, hit by the emergence of Podemos and Ciudadanos, and the fragmented political landscape has eluded efforts to agree a ruling coalition."
"176","Stocks surge, dollar rises after strong U.S. data.txt",287,516,31,"By Dion Rabouin

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Upbeat U.S. manufacturing data and another jump in oil prices on Tuesday pushed a leading gauge of global stocks to its highest in nearly two months.

U.S. stocks led the way, with bank shares up more than 3 percent after the strong data refreshed expectations that the Federal Reserve may raise rates later this year.

U.S. construction spending rose to the highest level since October 2007 and a measure of the U.S. manufacturing sector outpaced analysts' expectations across the board.

""If the manufacturing sector is now rebounding, thats very bullish,"" said Jonathan Lewis, chief investment officer at Fiera Capital Inc in New York.

""The (manufacturing) data was an accelerant,"" he said.

The U.S. data, alongside expectations of further support from major central banks, soothed fears over a slowing global economy.

""That reminded people we have more central banks to come this month, ""Lewis said. ""We get European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve, so were probably getting set up for a nice middle of the month.""

The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 348.58 points, or 2.11 percent, to 16,865.08, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 46.12 points, or 2.39 percent, to 1,978.35 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 131.65 points, or 2.89 percent, to 4,689.60.

It was the largest daily percentage gain since early January for the S&P 500. MSCI's global gauge of equity markets <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 1.8 percent, touching its highest level since Jan. 8.

The U.S. manufacturing data also prompted investors to strengthen their outlook on a possible U.S. interest rate increase by year-end.

Fed funds futures on Tuesday implied traders see a 58-percent chance of the U.S. central bank raising rates at its December policy meeting , higher than the 30 percent chance on Monday and more than four times greater than the 12 percent chance seen a month earlier, according CME Group's FedWatch tool.

CRUDE UP AGAIN

Oil prices followed equities higher and have risen in seven of the past 12 sessions. Brent , the global benchmark, was down 0.2 percent at $36.49 a barrel after settling up 0.7 percent at $36.81. U.S. crude settled up 1.9 percent at $34.40 a barrel and was last up 0.5 percent at $33.91.

Equities' surge pushed investors out of traditionally safe assets like U.S. government bonds, gold and the Japanese yen.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 25/32 in price to yield 1.825 percent, up from 1.74 percent late on Monday.

The dollar rose more than 1 percent against the yen , rebounding after its worst month against the Japanese currency since 2008.

Gold fell 0.5 percent to 1,231.67. It rose more than 10 percent in February, the most for any month in four years.

U p and at em: My day starts at seven, when our dog, Percival, and our kids, Madisonaddison and Andersoncooper, jump into bed with us. Percival is a Pigapoo, which is a very rare breed. Its a cross between a Shih Tzu and a pig. Percival has breathing problems, because hes an affront to Gods plan and isnt supposed to exist, so we have to be very careful when were roughhousing with him, or hell suffocate and well have to introduce our kids to the concept of death.

Breakfast in bed: On Sundays, we throw all our healthy habits out the window and really indulge, so its nothing but salami, doughnuts, and vegetable oil. Brian, my husband, makes the meanest salami-doughnut-vegetable-oil slop.

Breaking A sweat: I like to get exercise out of the way in the morning so I can relax for the rest of the day. Right now, Im completely obsessed with the Dock Method, which is this thing where you work on the docks for a few hours, tossing cargo into shipping holds, and they pay you $6.75 an hour. The guys in my class are super ripped, which is very motivating.

Culture club: After weve had our breakfast and moved around a little, we like to do something culturally enriching as a family, so usually its off to the Met to stroll through the vaults where they keep the stolen Nazi art. We have a platinum membership, which gets you into all the chambers.

Unplug and unwind: Weve recently started doing this thing where we totally disconnect for a few hours, and its been really liberating. No cell phones, no iPads, no laptops, nothing. We dont even use language. We limit ourselves to vowel sounds and grunts, and just get back in touch with our primal selves, roaming around the apartment, pissing and shitting at will, and foraging for scraps of salami. Heaven.

Gender check-in: We dont want the kids to be influenced by us or by society or by anybody when it comes to choosing their genders, so were giving them time to decide, and theyre still thinking about it. We dont want their decision to be influenced by the genitals that they happened to be born with, so we keep them dressed in breathable-cotton chastity belts, and as soon as they decide their genders well take them off so they can see which sex organs they have. Theyre only sophomores, so weve still got time before the big college search.

Grocery shopping: Sometimes, in the afternoon, well go grocery shopping for the week. Get milk, eggs, bread. Stuff like that.

Drop in on secret family: Ill check in with my secret family for a few hoursmake sure the heats on, that there are groceries in the fridge, that kind of thing.

Percivals P.T.: Because Percival is such a special breed, he has several genetic defects. For example, he was born without legs. Brian takes him to physical therapy at a wonderful vet weve been going to for years, and hell practice strengthening his neck so that he can pull himself forward.

Take everyone in a pediatric oncology ward to see Hamilton: Nothing makes you feel more grateful to be alive than popping into a pediatric oncology ward, saying, Come on, everybody!, and whisking all the patients away to see the hit Broadway musical Hamilton. Even though many of the children are terminal cases, they can still heed Alexander Hamiltons tip to not waste their shot with the time theyve got left.

Dinner: On Sunday nights, we like to take it easy and stay in, so Brian will do something simple, like take some olive oil, salt, and lemon and sprinkle it on a huge pile of salami, doughnuts, and vegetable oil.

Odds and Ends: When the dishes are done, Ill catch up on e-mail, help the kids with their homework, and see if any of my bids on Nazi-plundered art have come through.

Watch Kingpin : Well watch Kingpin a couple of times. Once for laughs, and once more to appreciate the craft.

Bedtime : After a glass of liquid melatonin, a few minutes of meditation, some gentle stretching, and a Motrin 800, Im out like a light. "
"178","Super Tuesday doesnt matter like Florida matters..txt",341,759,40,"Mike Carlson/Reuters

Donald Trump is set to win most of the contests on Super Tuesday, with a couple of potential surprises. He could pull off an upset in Texas against Ted Cruz, though Cruz appears to have retained his lead there even if Trump has slimmed the margin. It would behoove Marco Rubio, meanwhile, to win any stateperhaps Minnesotajust to show that he is capable of winning a nominating contest at some point.

Jim Newell Jim Newell is a Slate staff writer.

A surprise winner here or there would mostly serve PR purposes for campaigns. But proportional delegate allocationwhich differs in specifics by stateensures that no candidate will be able to deliver a structural shift in the campaign Tuesday night, even though Super Tuesday awards roughly a quarter of the partys total delegates. Trump should win a few hundred delegates, Cruz another hundred or two. Marco Rubio, the supposed savior, will likely be stuck in double-digits. Cruz will use his delegate advantage over Rubio as a justification for staying in the race, even if Cruzs prospects sharply diminish after the contests in Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Idaho on Saturday and next Tuesday.

In other words, the day after Super TuesdayWednesday, our sources tell us its calledwill feature the same race we saw before and during Super Tuesday. Trump will have a big but not insurmountable lead. Rubio, Cruz, and Kasich will each be spinning about how they should be the figure to go one-on-one against Trump. Rubio will continue knocking the hell out of Trump in the hope that he can win his home state of Florida. Kasich will be off doing his Kasich thing in Michigan and Ohio, praying that Trump knocks out Rubio in Florida. Cruz will putz around the South through March 8, and then pivot to praying that Trump knocks out Rubio in Florida.

Florida is the test for whether Rubio, the candidate rumored to have the broadest ability to take down Trump, can do it.

As you can see, Florida, which votes on March 15, is a fairly important contest. One can argueas I am doingthat Florida is more important to the race than the sum total of Super Tuesdays contests. Its not just that Floridaalong with other major states like Ohio and Illinoiscomes on the first day of pure winner-take-all contests. Its the test for whether Rubio, the candidate rumored to have the broadest ability to take down Trump, can do it.

Florida is Rubios home state, though thats not quite the advantage that it may seem. It helps with campaign infrastructure and know-how, but Rubio is not measurably more popular than Trump there. Trump also has ties to Florida, owning several resort properties there, and his massive lead in the Super Tuesday state of Alabama bodes well for his ability to accrue votes in the Florida panhandle. Rubios home-state advantage, in short, is canceled out by the competing fact that its also a state that fits Trump quite well. Hence Trumps significant lead.

Florida will serve as a microcosm for what needs to happen nationally to stop Trump from winning the nomination. It will effectively be a one-on-one contest. It will be expensive, with the Rubio campaign, its super PACs, and establishment-aligned conservative dark-money groups deploying possibly tens of millions of dollars against Trump from every angle of attack. Rubios kitchen-sink strategy against Trump has only been underway for five days, so looking at Super Tuesdays results to gauge their effectiveness doesnt give them enough time to settle. By Florida, well know if they work or not. If they do, and Rubio wins Florida, well know Rubio can beat Trump if the campaign is waged properly. This would reverberate in the remaining big contests across the country. Even if the math might be difficult for Rubio to win an outright majority of pledged delegates by that point, he could deny Trump his own majority and take his case to a contested convention.

If Rubio loses Florida, though, the race is over. His own campaign team has said you can take it to the bank that Rubio will win there. If Rubio cant pull it off, he will be humiliated. More importantly, he will be almost insurmountably behind Trumps delegate total, even after hes launched everything he had at the front-runner. He, along with Cruz and Kasich, could stay in the race for second-place bragging rightsor in the hope that, say, Trump realizes hes going to be the nominee and drops out because he never actually wanted to be president."
"179","Super Tuesday Edition.txt",158,268,13,"As supporters file into the Stage One Ice Palace in Miami to the tunes of a live band, the Clinton campaign is expressing confidence it is well on the way to a big night. Campaign press secretary Brian Fallon tells NPR that campaign workers believe Clinton can build up a big enough delegate lead by mid-March to put the nomination out of reach of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

As for expectations for tonight, Fallon says Sanders really only tried to compete in five states and Clinton should be able to keep most of those contests close enough to limit his delegate haul. Meanwhile, in the Southern states where Sanders didn't spend considerable time or money, Fallon says, Clinton should be able to notch decisive victories, adding to her delegate lead in a big way.

Fallon says Sanders did raise more money than Clinton in February, though he didn't provide the exact numbers. That means Sanders will have the strength to keep fighting on and no doubt win at least a few more states in the weeks ahead. Fallon says Clinton will keep fighting for every vote (a common refrain for the Clinton campaign for months now). But Fallon called on Sanders to elevate the dialogue and go back to focusing on issues. That is to say, since the Nevada caucuses Sanders has started calling on Clinton to release the transcripts from her Wall Street speeches. Those sorts of attacks could damage Clinton, and Fallon says it would be better for the Democratic Party if Sanders turned less negative.

It seems unlikely Sanders will appreciate Fallon's advice.  Tamara Keith"

Dr. John Robertson testified that paramedics worked to keep the blood pressure of Enietra Washington from plummeting after she was shot on Nov. 7, 1988. Robertson said he was working at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center when Washington was rushed in for treatment.

See the most-read stories this hour >>

Under questioning from Deputy Dist. Atty. Beth Silverman, Robertson said Washington's wound was consistent with her being shot as she sat in the passenger seat of a vehicle while her assailant was in the driver's seat.

The testimony echoed Washington's recounting of her ordeal last week.

Washington testified she was attacked after accepting a ride from a man in an orange Ford Pinto. The man shot her as she sat in the passenger seat and forced himself on her, she recounted.

See more of our top stories on Facebook >>

In the downtown Los Angeles courtroom where the trial is taking place, Washington identified Lonnie Franklin, now 63, as her attacker.

Prosecutors allege that Franklin, a former LAPD garage attendant, is responsible for a series of 10 slayings and the attempted murder of Washington during a period that spanned more than 20 years. He has pleaded not guilty.

Jurors also heard testimony from Debra Gibson, a criminalist with the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner.

The UN's special envoy to Syria has said peace talks have been pushed back to 9 March to allow the cessation of hostilities to ""settle down"".

The previous round of peace talks last month collapsed after only two days.

The latest truce has led to a marked reduction in violence, but both sides have complained of violations.

President Bashar al-Assad insisted on an interview on Tuesday that the government ""will do our part so that the whole thing works"".

""We have refrained ourselves from retaliating in order to give (a) chance for the agreement to survive,"" Mr Assad told the German ARD TV station.

However, France has expressed concern about reports of strikes by Syrian government and Russian aircraft on areas controlled by mainstream rebels.

Also on Tuesday, Nato's most senior commander in Europe accused Russia of helping the Syrian government to create a refugee crisis as a weapon of war.

Referring to what he termed Russia's ""imprecise"" use of air power, Gen Philip Breedlove told a committee in Washington: ""I don't know what military utility that would have other than to get people displaced and on the road and into someone else's problem set.""

For its part Russia said on Tuesday it had counted 15 violations of the cessation of hostilities in the past 24 hours.

In the interview with ARD, Mr Assad said that a ""full amnesty"" was on offer for rebel fighters if they agreed to disarm.

""The most important thing for me, legally and constitutionally... (is) that you're not allowed, as a citizen, to hold machine-guns and hurt people or properties,"" he said.

Mr Assad is blamed for the vast majority of the civilian deaths among the 250,000 people who have been killed in the conflict, and it is not clear that many fighters would take up the offer of an amnesty.

Earlier US Secretary of State John Kerry said that all alleged violations of the cessation of hostilities would be investigated.

He said the US and Russia were working on a mechanism to ensure air strikes only targeted so-called Islamic State (IS) or al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Anti-government protesters have returned to the streets in several Syrian towns

The relative calm brought about the cessation of hostilities has encourage some opposition activists to stage protests against Mr Assad's rule.

Syria's conflict started as a wave of peaceful protests against Mr Assad in March 2011 which morphed into an armed conflict after the initial demonstrations were brutally suppressed.

Some of the protesters have been using slogans reminiscent of 2011's ""Arab Spring"" wave of protests in the region.

""Of course we're going to seize this opportunity (to protest) because the rest of the time there were constant barrel bombs and shelling,"" Shadi Matar, an activist in the town of Daraya near Damascus, told AFP.

As well as the death toll, the conflict has created millions of refugees and left hundreds of thousands of people in areas without basic supplies.

The UN and its partners have been stepping up deliveries of food, water and medicine, and plan to reach more than 150,000 people over the next five days.

They hope to help 1.7 million in hard-to-reach areas by the end of March.

The UN says more than 450,000 Syrians are trapped in 15 besieged towns and villages, while 4.1 million others are living in hard-to-reach areas.

Syria's civil war

Why is there a war in Syria?

Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory.

What's the human cost?

More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and a million injured. Some 11 million others have been forced from their homes, of whom four million have fled abroad - including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe.

How has the world reacted?

Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are supporting the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran have pro-Assad forces on the ground, while Russia and a Western-led coalition are carrying out air strikes.

"185","Testing kids for grit is a big mistake, says the worlds foremost authority on it.txt",276,522,25,"This autumn, a handful of California school districts will start testing kids on non-cognitive skills like grit, mindset, and self-control, the New York Times reported today (Mar. 1).

Changes to a federal education law require states to assess schools on at least one non-academic measure. Research has shown that social-emotional traits like self-control and perseverance can be better predictors of success than standardized test scores, or other purely academic measures.

But Angela Duckworth, perhaps the worlds foremost authority on grit and the author of much of the research on the topic, says this is a big mistake.

I do not think we should be doing this; it is a bad idea, Duckworth told the Times.

Duckworth, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, has shown that grit, defined by her as the tendency to sustain interest in and effort toward very long-term goals, is a good predictor of success in everything from surviving the grueling trials of military academies to reaching the final rounds of spelling bees and simply graduating from public high school.

She has also shown than self-control can predict report-card grades, and changes in these grades over time, better than measured intelligence.

Naturally, understanding how to improve kids grit is of interest to educators and parents. Duckworth thinks that it can can be taught, and that it can grow over time. This is similar to the work of Stanford researcher Carol Dweck, who discovered that kids learn more when they believe intelligence is malleable, and that a growth mindset can be developed over time.

Duckworth has previously outlined her misgivings about the measurement of non-cognitive abilities she thinks are critically important. Testing these traits will be difficult, in part because there are so many of them (empathy, self-control, mindset, zest) and there are a range of definitions for them. Another major obstacle is the tests are faulty: self-reported surveys and teacher questionnaires present a host of problems, including students and teachers biases. As she wrote, along with David Scott Yeager from the University of Texas at Austin:

Our claim is not that everything that counts can be counted or that everything that can be counted counts. Rather, we argue that the field urgently requires much greater clarity about how well, at present, it is able to count some of the things that count.

Here is Duckworths attempt at a grit test, which can produce some pretty weird results.

Some New York Times readers comments were appropriately skeptical of Californias grit-testing plans. So when do parents get to sign their kids up for grit building classes?, asked one, hardly a stretch when parents now hire tutors for nursery school interviews. Said another, Tests for joy? The very definition of an oxymoron. More than a few noted also noted that schools seem to be giving rewards to kids for behavior once considered standard (conscientiousness, self-control).

Testing has been on the rise in the United States for some time, much to the chagrin of many parents who say it is stressing their kids out and does nothing for their academic achievement. More testing for more ambiguous measures hardly seems like the solution."
"186","The art that shows what goes on deep in the human brain.txt",499,1147,76,"Image copyright Trustees of the British Museum

From scary sleep paralysis, to recalling memories that never happened, a new exhibition is exploring the art inspired by human consciousness. Here, we see how artists have interpreted moments from the mind.

Do you dream sweet dreams each night - drifting gently in and out of sleep? Or is the boundary between sleeping and waking a more frightening experience?

It is thought close to 8% of people are prone to experiencing ""sleep paralysis"" - a condition which can leave sufferers with a temporary inability to move or speak. It is not the same as a bad dream or unsettled sleep.

""You are in a state where you are awake, but your body is paralysed and your breathing is restricted,"" says Emily Sargent from Wellcome Collection.

""You are aware of your surroundings but are unable to cry out. You may have visual or audible hallucinations. You could feel presence of an imagined malign intruder.""

Sleep paralysis is one of a number of conditions on the edge of human consciousness being explored at the Wellcome Collection in London in the exhibition, States of Mind.

Image copyright Trustees of the British Museum

""People describe feeling a weight on their chest,"" says Sargent, ""depicted here in monstrous form in this 18th Century drawing by Henry Fuseli.""

The woman is also on her back and with her head lower than her body - another hallmark of a sleep paralysis attack.

In some cultures the condition has been enshrined in folklore.

Here, Fudo Myo-o - one of the important deities in Japanese Buddhism - holds a metal chain in his left hand ready to ""paralyse"" a sleeping enemy.

Image copyright Trustees of the British Museum

The next image, of a dissected brain, was drawn by the French philosopher and scientist Rene Descartes.

""We wanted to tease out the voices which have talked about consciousness,"" says Sargent. ""He's known as the father of dualism - the idea that we are made of body stuff and mind stuff - one earthly, the other enduring.""

The image shows the grape-shaped pineal gland in the centre, which Descartes believed was the seat of the soul.

""It gives us the principle of a magical ghost in the human machine.""

Image copyright Wellcome Library

Descartes' thinking - of a separation of body and soul - played well with the world's major religions, including Christianity.

The next image - created for a poem, The Grave by Robert Blair - shows the earthly body of a young man laid out, and his female soul leaving him for heaven.

Image copyright Trustees of the British Museum

""I like to think of my memories as a box of old photos which remain true each time I return. But memory doesn't really work like that,"" says Sargent.

""The brain is doing its best job all the time, but is surprisingly vulnerable to influence.""

The exhibition challenges our idea of being able to accurately remember moments from the past - and considers the relative ease of creating false memories.

The next images show a shopping centre - deserted, except for some young children. They were created by artist AR Hopwood, who was inspired by research from American psychologist Elizabeth Loftus.

Image copyright A R Hopwood

Loftus and her team demonstrated that you could, through suggestion, persuade about 25% of people that they had been lost in a shopping mall as a child - even though they had not.

Her study in the mid-1990s involved students at University of Washington, and an older relative - often a parent.

The students were asked to recall events from their childhood - details of which were provided by the relatives. But details of one event - getting lost in a shopping mall - were false.

Image copyright A R Hopwood

Claire's story is also featured. She has severe amnesia and can't recognise faces.

""The past exists as a space you can't enter or feel, and the future as a space you can't imagine,"" she writes.

She was left with the condition after developing a serious brain lesion following an infection.

When she left hospital she had to be told who her children were.

Image copyright Shona Illingworth / Amnesia Museum

To try to combat the effect of her memory loss, Claire wears a device called a SenseCam around her neck - which takes photos throughout her day.

Image copyright Shona Illingworth / Amnesia Museum

These images were taken on a visit she made to St Kilda, 40 miles (64km) west of North Uist in the Western Isles.

""Claire can look back at the photos at the end of the day,"" says Sargent, ""and they will trigger memories for her which would be otherwise inaccessible.""

Image copyright Shona Illingworth / Amnesia Museum

What could happen to you when you are made unconscious clinically?

Could a mischievous group of tiny blue men jump on you - armed with a hammer, callipers and miniature musical instruments? No.

But what the next image does do is bring to mind a patient's feeling of mistrust when they are under anaesthesia.

""Consciousness under anaesthetic is not like going to sleep, it's more like a coma,"" says Sargent.

""Patients are assisted with breathing, and there are no sleep-wake cycles.""

Even though sometimes, eyes remain open.

But there have been accounts of patients being awake but immobile - in a disordered sense of consciousness - when they were supposedly under anaesthesia.

The images come from a 2005 film by Israeli artist Aya Ben Ron, in which she shows the moments from operating theatres when patients fell unconscious under general anaesthetic.

Between 2009-11, the same artist looked at the treatment of young patients in persistent vegetative states - who received care at the Reut Medical Center in Tel Aviv.

""Patients in a PVS show no response to stimulae, but they do have sleep-wake cycles,"" says Sargent. ""Eyes will open, but they won't track when you shine a light.""

She explains how the exhibition looks at the long-term work of British neuroscientist Adrian Owen, who is trying to unlock that world.

""How do you get into the brain of someone who doesn't respond to anything?""

Owen scanned the brains of PVS patients in the UK and Canada - and spoke to them during the procedure.

He asked them to think about two things - walking around their own homes and playing tennis.

In normal circumstances - thoughts of spatial navigation, and moving arms back and forth - would register certain brain activity.

Owen found that 20% of those patients tested were able to respond to his commands - using the two imagined tasks to communicate.

""While there was a response from just a minority of those tested,"" says Sargent, ""in some cases patients were forming new memories.""

"187","The Bidding War.txt",2126,8005,419,"Americas war in Afghanistan, which is now in its fifteenth year, presents a mystery: how could so much money, power, and good will have achieved so little? Congress has appropriated almost eight hundred billion dollars for military operations in Afghanistan; a hundred and thirteen billion has gone to reconstruction, more than was spent on the Marshall Plan, in postwar Europe. General David Petraeus, a principal architect of U.S. counterinsurgency strategy, encouraged the practice of pumping money into the economy of Afghanistan, where the per-capita G.D.P. at the time of the invasion was around a hundred and twenty dollars. He believed that money had helped buy peace during his command of American forces in Iraq. Employ money as a weapons system, Petraeus wrote in 2008. Money can be ammunition. 

The result was a war waged as much by for-profit companies as by the military. Political debate in Washington has focussed on the number of troops deployed in Afghanistan and the losses that they have sustained. To minimize casualties, the military outsourced any task that it could: maintenance, cooking and laundry, overland logistics, even security. Since 2007, there have regularly been more contractors than U.S. forces in Afghanistan; today, they outnumber them three to one.

One result has been forms of corruption so extreme that the military has, in some cases, funded its own enemy. When a House committee investigated the trucking system that supplied American forces, it found that the system had fueled a vast protection racket run by a shadowy network of warlords, strongmen, commanders, corrupt Afghan officials, and perhaps others. Its report concluded that protection payments for safe passage are a significant potential source of funding for the Taliban. The system risked undermining the U.S. strategy for achieving its goals in Afghanistan.

The system has also made a few individuals very rich. Hikmatullah Shadman, an Afghan trucking-company owner, earned more than a hundred and sixty million dollars while contracting for the United States military; for the past three years, he has been battling to save much of his fortune in a federal court in Washington, D.C. In United States of America v. Sum of $70,990,605, et al., the Justice Department has accused Hikmat, as hes known, of bribing contractors and soldiers to award him contracts. Hikmat has maintained his innocence, even as eight soldiers have pleaded guilty in related criminal cases. Several members of the Special Forces who have not been accused of wrongdoing have defended him. In a deposition, Major Jerry (Rusty) Bradley, a veteran Special Forces officer, said, The only way to right a wrong of this magnitude is to be willing to draw your sword and defend everything that you believe in.

I first met Hikmat in June, 2014, at his office in downtown Kabul, on a main road crowded with taxis and venders hawking stewed chickpeas. The compound once belonged to Ahmad Zahir, a famous pop singer of the nineteen-seventies. We sat in a living room that, with its low ceiling, floral wall print, and paper lanterns, resembled a California den from that period.

Hikmat, who is in his late twenties, looks disarmingly young and gentle. Slim, with a high brow that he often furrows, he countered the charges against him in grave, deliberate English. The people who did this investigation were sitting in air-conditioned rooms, he told me. They dont know what was happening in the field. He offered to explain how he had made his fortune. I was part of the Special Forces family, he said. I was trained by them.

Before the Americans came, Hikmat lived with his father, a schoolteacher; his mother; and five siblings in a four-room mud-walled house in one of the oldest parts of Kandahar City, in southern Afghanistan. In the summer of 2001, Hikmat was fourteen years old, and he and his friends chafed at the narrowness of life under the Taliban. No one had a telephone, televisions were banned, and there was rarely any electricity. Sometimes, Hikmat recalled, the Taliban would round up the schoolboys and take them to see executions at the citys soccer stadium. There was a black umbrella on top of us, he said. We were not connected to the world.

Eager for a glimpse of life outside Afghanistan, Hikmat would watch movies at the house of a Hindu friend, on a tiny, illicit television with the volume turned low and the blinds pulled down. They liked Bollywood dramas and Hollywood action films, and would try out the foreign-sounding names: Van Damme, Bruce Lee, Rambo. At home, in the evenings, Hikmats father listened to the BBCs Pashto service while taking notes on world events in a diary. My father was always studying at night, Hikmat said. He was always working.

On September 11, 2001, Hikmat came home to find his parents sitting by the radio, stunned by the news from New York. Like many Afghans, they didnt understand why their country was said to be responsible, but it soon became clear that the Americans would attack. Hikmat imagined that, like the action heroes in his films, they would come on foot, in a spray of bullets. He was so excited, he said, that he sneaked out and wrote in chalk on the wall of a mosque, Long live Bush.

The Americans came in B-52s instead, raining bombs on the Taliban and the Arab foreign fighters who had become their allies. Hikmat and his family fled across the border to Karachi, in Pakistan. Kabul fell in November, but Kandahar held out until December 7th, when a convoy of Afghan militiamen, led by the warlord Gul Agha Sherzai, entered the city, accompanied by C.I.A. advisers and U.S. Special Forces. Hikmats family rushed back to Kandahar. The next day, residents celebrated and played music in the streets. For the first time in years, videocassettes were sold openly. When a convoy of Special Forces drove through town, with soldiers as muscled and heavily armed as Rambo, Hikmat joined the crowd that was walking alongside them, waving and smiling. On the radio, the countrys new leader, forty-three-year-old Hamid Karzai, a former diplomat, promised a bright future of peace and development; after decades of war and isolation, the economy was reviving in Kandahar.

But, that winter, Hikmats father fell ill with stomach cancer, and died soon afterward. To support his mother and sisters, Hikmat tended a French-fry and juice stand. In June, 2002, he found work cleaning and making repairs at a Special Forces base that the Americans had set up at Kandahars airport.

Sami Ghairatmal, a childhood friend, told me that Hikmat was always driven to improve himself. He studied more than us, he said. He learned good and fluent English. After the project at the base ended, a friend of Hikmats who was working as a security guard for the U.S. military asked Hikmat to see him about another job. Borrowing his brothers motorcycle, Hikmat drove out to the former compound of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar, in the hills north of the city. Both the C.I.A. and the Special Forces had set up at the compound, which they called Camp Gecko, after the noisy lizards that lived there. The roof was destroyed, but workers were putting up new buildings. Eventually, the complex had a cafeteria with a fireplace, a fountain with catfish, and a swimming pool.

Hikmats friend took him to meet Bryan Myers, a twenty-two-year-old engineering sergeant who had just arrived for his first tour in Afghanistan with the Desert Eagles, a battalion of the 3rd Special Forces Group, which deployed frequently to Kandahar in the course of the war. Myers was a barrel-chested man who, like most Green Berets, as the Special Forces are known, had a beard that distinguished him from the clean-shaven regular troops. He later wrote an account of his meeting with Hikmat, which Hikmats lawyers submitted in court:

How old are you, kid? I am 16, about, sir. Yeah no, thats not going to happen. Sorry but there is no way. Tony, I am sorry but we cant hire a kid, its too dangerous and he doesnt bring anything to the table.

As Hikmat turned to go, Myers mentioned that a rucksack and some gun covers needed repairing; Hikmat offered to do it. His mother sewed up the rucksack, and when he declined payment Myers and the team, impressed by his honesty, decided to take him on:

Hik, your English is pretty good. You know what we do here right? Of course, you are the bearded ones, everybody knows what you do. That is why I want to work with you. Laughing, I just put my hand on his shoulder and respond Welcome aboard.

Hikmat spent the next three years as an interpreter, living and fighting alongside Myers and other Green Berets. He earned up to fifteen hundred dollars a month, twenty times the salary of an Afghan police officer. In the eyes of Hikmatullah, the bearded ones were sent upon him as an answer to many of [his] prayers, Myers wrote.

The Special Forces, who are known as quiet professionals, focus less on commando raidsthe hallmark of other lite units, such as the Delta Force and the Navy SEAL sthan on training and fighting with allied local forces. During the invasion, they had embedded with Afghan warlords and their militias, and afterward they were left behind to hunt the remnants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda across Afghanistans remote mountains and deserts.

We were inherently different, Rusty Bradley, who served as an officer with the Desert Eagles, wrote in Lions of Kandahar, a 2011 memoir. We ate, slept, lived, and breathed with the Afghan people as if we had done so all our lives, immersing ourselves in their language and culture. Bradley deployed to Kandahar eight times, eventually learning rudimentary Pashto. After Myers rotated back to the U.S., Hikmat worked for Bradleys team, and the two grew close. He compared Bradley, who weighed two hundred and thirty pounds, to Sylvester Stallone; Bradley has credited Hikmat with saving his life by putting himself between Bradley and an armed insurgent. I wasnt just an interpreter, Hikmat told me.

By 2006, the American military was focussed mostly on Iraq, and the Taliban had retaken much of the countryside in southern Afghanistan. That summer, Bradley and Myers redeployed with the Desert Eagles to Kandahar. In Operation Medusa, one of the largest battles of the war, U.S. and Canadian troops attacked Taliban fighters west of the city with tanks, artillery, and airpower. It looked like a monster had stomped through the valley, leaving skeletons of compounds smoldering and tops of trees jagged and twisted, Bradley wrote.

Hikmats mother, fearing for his safety, pleaded with him to stop working as an interpreter. Three interpreters in Kandahar had recently been captured and beheaded by the Taliban. I lied to my mom, he said, telling her that he had stayed on the base during the operation. He had started a side business selling fruit and soft drinks to the base, and that winter he quit his job as an interpreter in order to work on the business full time. Hikmat told me that a sergeant major at the Special Forces headquarters helped him register it at the main U.S. base, known as Kandahar Airfield, or KAF . On February 25, 2007, Hikmat signed a blanket purchase agreement with the U.S. military, an open-ended contract for trucking services. He started with a single rented truck.

Hikmats entry into the trucking business brought him into competition with some of Kandahars most powerful men. Gul Agha Sherzai, the warlord who had retaken the province with the help of the C.I.A. and Special Forces, had been the governor; his brother Abdul Raziq was a general in the Afghan Army, in charge of the airport. The Sherzais also controlled lucrative contracts to supply gravel to the American base, and Raziqs company, Sherzai Construction and Supply, provided trucks to the Americans. Weve had a friendship since 2001, Raziq told me in his office on KAF . He had a framed photograph on his desk of himself with General John Campbell, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. From that time, Im their partner.

To many Afghans, warlords like the Sherzais were scarcely more legitimate than the Taliban. After the Communist government fell, in 1992, Gul Agha and his men had taken part in the civil war that pillaged Kandahar. Now, with U.S. dollars, Governor Sherzai had constituted his own private militia, Sarah Chayes, a journalist turned aid worker, writes, in The Punishment of Virtue, her 2006 account of life in Kandahar. But the Americans saw the political landscape in Afghanistan through the dichotomies of the war on terror, and in Kandahar they relied on the Sherzais to help identify the enemy. Before long, the U.S. forces were helplessly wrapped inside the [Sherzais] friendly bear hug, Chayes continues. Bradley, who referred to the Taliban as savages, wrote, Every day was like September 12, 2001. Raids by U.S. Special Operations Forces, in conjunction with the Sherzais, compelled former Taliban leaders to move to Pakistan, where they began to revive the insurgency.

As an interpreter, Hikmat had often been in meetings with the Sherzais, though they hardly noticed him in those days. We wouldnt even greet him, I remember, Khalid Pashtoon, a member of the Afghan parliament who was then an aide to Gul Agha Sherzai, said. Hikmat told me that he understood why the Americans aligned themselves with people like the Sherzais against the Taliban. There is bad and worse, he said. You would choose bad.

Now he was their rival in a more and more lucrative business. Unlike the Iraq war, in which international companies brought in supplies, in Afghanistan the military outsourced its overland-logistics chain to local contractors, whose jingle trucks, so called because of their colorful, tinkling metal decorations, hauled cargo to bases across the countrys remote and increasingly dangerous terrain. In the beginning, contractors like Hikmat were paid in cash by the U.S. military after missions were completed. Glad to have an alternative to the Sherzais, the Special Forces welcomed him. I was never saying no to any job, Hikmat said. They want anything, anytime, and you have to be ready.

Hikmat had chosen the right time to start. Between 2007 and 2010, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan increased from fourteen thousand to nearly a hundred thousand. And they were outnumbered by a second, private army: by June, 2010, more than a hundred and seven thousand contractors were working for the Department of Defense. The jobs were dangerousmore contractors had been killed so far that year than U.S. soldiersbut the payoff was substantial. Between 2007 and 2014, the U.S. spent eighty-nine billion dollars on contracting in Afghanistan.

There were so many contracts out there that you could win anything you wanted, Simon Hilliard, a former British soldier who worked on KAF as the managing director of Watan Risk Management, an Afghan-owned security company, told me. The margins were insane. He said that, in eighteen months, Watans revenues increased from five hundred thousand dollars to fifty-eight million.

Built as a spartan military encampment, KAF became a city of tens of thousands, with paved roads and a state-of-the-art trauma hospital, as well as a Burger King and a T.G.I. Fridays, all coated with fine desert dust and permeated by the smell of the poo pond. The U.S. and its allies eventually built more than five hundred military bases in Afghanistan. Many of them had hot showers and Internet cafs. Soldiers who patrolled mud-walled villages without plumbing or electricity, in temperatures that rose to a hundred and thirty degrees, slept in air-conditioned tents so cold that they needed blankets. It all consumed enormous amounts of fuel: in 2010, Bagram Airfield, which was comparable in size to KAF , used nearly 1.6 million gallons per week.

Most of the fuel was transported by trucks like Hikmats, and what had originally been an ad-hoc system grew into a countrywide network that handled billions of dollars in freight. Even its management was outsourced. In October, 2007, not long after Hikmat rented his first truck, the contract to set up a Jingle Truck Coordination Office, a job originally handled by the U.S. military, was signed by TOIFOR , a German company that was founded in the nineteen-nineties to supply portable toilets to NATO forces preparing to go into Bosnia. It was an absolutely minor, small, small, little thing, Karl Friedrich Krause, one of the companys founders, told me. A small job done by one guy.

That guy was Roren Stowell, a Denver native with a snowboarders drawl. We were about two weeks away from taking over, Stowell told me. They didnt have a pencil. As troop levels surged, Stowell said, where before they were doing maybe twenty trucks a week, in a short amount of time we were going upward of four or five hundred trucks on any given day.

Stowell went on, There were million-dollar truck runs, paying upward of forty-five thousand dollars per truck. The military didnt seem to mind the expense, as long as U.S. soldiers didnt have to risk their lives on the road. The attitude, he said, was Fuck it. Theres an endless amount of moneyjust get the trucks there and keep the customers happy.

The money created a local ecosystem, with KAF at its apex. Stowell and his team awarded supply requests from military units to a group of Afghan trucking companies, based on price, availability, and dependability. He soon realized that, while his subcontractorswho included both Hikmat and Sherzaihad their own fleets, they also acted as brokers for the rest of Kandahars truckers, hiring them and adding a hefty percentage to the cost. The subcontractors advantage was their access to the base and what were known locally as awwal las, or first-hand, contracts.

Millions of dollars were being paid by the U.S. government to private companies, but the intermediary was typically a low-level military officer, contractor, or civil servant. The temptation to take part in the profiteering was substantial. According to a study published in May, 2015, by the Center for Public Integrity, at least a hundred and fifteen U.S. service members who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan have been convicted of bribery, theft, and contract-rigging charges since 2005.

It was obvious that there was an opportunity to make money by giving a specific company more missions, Stowell said. He told me that once, when he was sent to Dubai to collect sewer-cleaning equipment, one of TOIFOR s subcontractors, Tawazuh, offered to have someone guide him around the city. Im picturing this guy who will take me to HomePro, Stowell said. Instead, several men picked him up in a Mercedes-Benz. They offered him a Rolex watch as a gift, which he refused. Im like, dude, Im looking for a Roto-Rooter, I dont need a fucking entourage, Stowell told me. Undeterred, the men drove him around Dubai and, that evening, tried to introduce him to some Russian women at a night club. Stowell said he told them, I cant take any Rolexes, I cant take any hos, and I dont want to go to any more dinners. (Sadeeq Mohmand, Tawazuhs owner, has denied offering gifts or bribes.)

While Stowell decided which Afghan companies would supply conventional units, the Special Forces were allowed to choose the companies they preferred, on the ground that they had unique requirements. Theyd come in and be like, No way, the only company thats going to do it is this company, Stowell said. And Im like, Yeah, man, but theyre three times the price of the other guys.

Hikmat had just begun his business when Stowell arrived on KAF . By the time he left, in late 2008, Hikmat was making his first millions. He kind of came in as an underdog, Stowell said. He was so young. I was just sitting there thinking, Hows this guy doing it?

In January, 2008, Tonya Long, a twenty-five-year-old staff sergeant, arrived on KAF , where she spent six months working with the Jingle Truck Office and its contractors to cordinate her units resupply missions. In late 2010, federal agents confronted her over her lavish spending on furniture, a trucking business, and a vacation to Disney World. She pleaded guilty to smuggling back to the U.S. approximately a million dollars in cash, stuffed inside VCRs, money that she said had come from Afghan contractors.

Long, who is serving a five-year prison sentence, told me in an e-mail that the bribery scheme was already in place when she arrived on KAF . She was involved in an affair with an Army captain who worked in logistics for the Bush Hogs, a sister battalion of the Desert Eagles in the 3rd Special Forces Group. The captain, she wrote, had been taking bribes from Tawazuh in return for steering contracts to the company and for creating fake missions, which the U.S. government was billed for. (Mohmand has denied this.) When the Bush Hogs were replaced by another Special Forces battalion, in early 2008, the captains successor, Captain Franklin Rivera-Medina, took over the scheme, but he favored another company: Hikmats.

To justify the choice of contractors, the first captain said that ONLY Tawazuh was reliable and Rivera said that ONLY Hikmat was reliable, Long, who also had an affair with Rivera, wrote.

The first captain, who retired from the military, was never charged, and refused to comment. The Justice Department also declined to comment. (At Longs sentencing hearing, the prosecution stated, We know that the prior captain did the false-claim scheme as well.)

Rivera, when questioned by the F.B.I., admitted to receiving eighty thousand dollars from Hikmat. He pleaded guilty to charges of cash smuggling and taking gratuities, but he died in 2014, before he could be sentenced. According to a prosecution document, Hikmat admitted to paying Rivera a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash, but he said that the money was compensation to the military for missing shipments.

Bank statements submitted in court by Hikmats lawyers show that fluctuations in his earnings appear to correlate with the presence of different Special Forces battalions in Kandahar. His first six months of invoices to TOIFOR averaged a hundred thousand dollars a month; after April, 2008, when Rivera arrived on KAF , they rose sharply, totalling almost thirteen million dollars for the rest of the year. Then, in early 2009, Bradley and the Desert Eagles were back in Kandahar. Hikmats invoices kept climbing, reaching $7.7 million in May; by the end of the year, he had billed TOIFOR more than forty-five million dollars. Captain Edward Woodall, a supply officer with the Desert Eagles, later wrote that the Special Forces required a level of trust and dependability that only Mr. Shadman could provide.

But in the winter of 2010 a new Special Forces battalion arrived, and it seemed to prefer Tawazuh. That month, Hikmat billed for less than half a million dollars. In Kandahar, Mohmand, Tawazuhs owner, showed me a certificate of appreciation signed by the battalions commander. I worked with the Americans very honestly and sincerely, he said. My rates are also less than other contractors.

When the Desert Eagles returned later that year, Hikmats business recovered. Woodall, who was in charge of the service detachment, obtained a sole source memo, which the Desert Eagles used to bypass TOIFOR s selection process and to work with Hikmat when they wanted. Hikmat set his own prices, and, according to his lawyers, they were reviewed by both TOIFOR and the military. I think I remember hearing that it was more expensive to use Hikmat than the other companies, but that was all right with my chain of command because the mission was more dangerous and he was the only one who could and would do it, Caleb Hardin, one of Woodalls subordinates, wrote in a declaration submitted by Hikmats lawyers.

Hikmats invoices to TOIFOR reached new heights. Bradley and Myers were back in Kandahar during the Bush Hogs next rotation, which replaced Woodalls in early 2011. In September alone, Hikmats invoices to TOIFOR amounted to $17.4 million. One form from the Bush Hogs requesting a trucking mission contains a handwritten justification for Hikmats higher prices: Always on time, never any issues, and understands how [Special Forces] operates. Hikmats bid was five thousand dollars; those of three other Afghan subcontractors were $2,500, $2,124, and $1,000.

Hikmat told me that his higher prices were the result of the extra flexibility he gave the Special Forces. Often, he said, they would change the mission at the last minute, for security reasons. I told them, dont tell me the date, dont tell me the time, and dont tell me the destination, he said.

Hikmats earnings from TOIFOR made up the lions share of a highly lucrative business. According to his bank statements, his logistics companies took in a hundred and sixty-seven million dollars between late 2007 and the end of 2012. During that period, he withdrew eighty-eight million. Even assuming that the withdrawals were all for business expenses, rather than investments or personal spending (Hikmat also owned a gas station and an energy-drink company, and employed a mostly Filipino office staff, led by Western expatriates), that left him with almost eighty million dollarsa profit margin of nearly fifty per cent. (According to Hikmats lawyer, Hikmat has millions of dollars in unpaid debts, and is owed between fifty and sixty million dollars by the U.S. government.)

By the time he was in his early twenties, Hikmat was one of the wealthiest men in Kandahar. He got married, made the hajj, and travelled through Europe, visiting the Eiffel Tower and the stadium where Real Madrid, his favorite soccer team, plays. Every Ramadan, he showered money on those in his neighborhood he judged to be poor and deserving. Rumors spread that Hikmat would drive around in an old car, a scarf half obscuring his face, handing out hundred-dollar bills to laborers. One cash giveaway at his gas station led to a near-riot that had to be dispersed with live ammunition. It was around this time that people started calling him Shadman, which means happy.

The vast sums that he was handling also impressed the foreigners on KAF . Once, Hikmat told me, a Canadian soldier who searched him at the entrance found ten thousand dollars. He marvelled at the thick bundle of bills. He said, Oh, wow, just hit me with it on my face. I like it, Ive never seen such money,  Hikmat said, smiling at the memory.

Hikmat outfitted his living quarters on KAF with flat-screen TVs and opulent furniture, including an oversized bed. Nothing fits together, because its the most expensive stuff thats picked out of every magazine, one of Hikmats managers said. Everythings gold and shiny, and its got crystal in it. Yet Hikmat never used his ornate bed, preferring, like most Afghans, to sleep on a mat on the floor. He sat cross-legged with the locals, with baba and the guy that makes the food, the manager said.

The Special Forces were frequent visitors. In 2011, Hikmat hosted a Christmas party, and Myers attended. In a photograph, Myers is wearing a checked shirt, and appears conspicuously massive next to Hikmats diminutive Filipino employees. There was a plastic Christmas tree on a stand draped in an American flag. The guests ate pizza and drank Red Bull, and Hikmat, beaming and rosy-cheeked, handed out gifts from a secret-Santa exchange. Myers took part in a three-legged race, pulling one of the Filipino staff people along with him. It was one of the most bizarre evenings of my life, Franco Swart, a South African who managed one of Hikmats trucking companies, said.

But Hikmat was under pressure in Kandahar. He said that the Taliban had attempted to kidnap his brother, and had also threatened him at his familys house. After a few days, they stuck a letter on the door, that in three days if you dont leave the job we will kill even the kids, he said. In February, 2011, he had applied to a State Department program that allowed interpreters and other Afghan employees of the U.S. to emigrate to America. I am requesting a Visa to the US in the case of an emergency, he wrote, citing the Talibans threat to his life. Bradley and three other Special Forces soldiers provided supporting letters. The Bush Hogs commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Carty, wrote, The loyalty and commitment Hikmatullah displays in supporting [the special-operations task force] and its mission goes unmatched.

In November, 2009, Scott Lindsay, a staffer on the House Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, was flying back from Pakistan when George Miller, a Democratic representative from California, handed him an article from The Nation. How the US Funds the Taliban, by Aram Roston, claimed that Afghan trucking companies working for the American military were paying off insurgents. Scott, do you know anything about this? Miller asked.

Over the next eight months, Lindsay and a team from the subcommittee interviewed U.S. military officials and contractors and reviewed thousands of documents. It was immediately glaring that, oh, my God, this could be as bad as alleged, Lindsay told me.

The U.S. military had decided to make trucking companies responsible for hiring their own security. As the country descended into violence, the companies were forced to pay off the men who controlled the roads, whether they were crooked officials, warlords, or Taliban. The whole thing became this inadvertently but inherently corrupt enterprise that, to me, symbolized the failure of the entire adventure, Lindsay said. If you have to pay your enemy for the right to be there, somethings gone wrong.

In June, 2010, the subcommittee released a report, titled Warlord, Inc., which concluded that U.S. government funds were likely going to the same people who were killing American soldiers. According to the subcommittee, the military had known about the problem for at least a year, but, Lindsay told me, absolutely nothing was done.

The perception among many of the trucking companies on KAF was that the U.S. military was turning a blind eye to where its money was ending up. We all knew what was happening, Rodney Castleman, an American employee of an Afghan trucking company, told me. You could be hardcore about stuff and say, Were not going to pay nobody, but, Im telling you, you were going to get hit on the road.

The report landed amid a growing realization in Washington that corruption in Afghanistan was jeopardizing President Obamas plan to stabilize the country before withdrawing American troops. That fall, Afghanistans financial system nearly collapsed after it was revealed that a group of well-connected businessmen and officialsincluding the brothers of President Karzai and his first Vice-Presidenthad fraudulently acquired nearly a billion dollars in loans from Kabul Bank. Far from being a source of stability, American money was part of the problem, and U.S. officials had little idea where it was going.

I am deeply troubled that the U.S. military can pursue, attack, and even kill terrorists and their supporters, John Sopko, the head of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction ( SIGAR ), later wrote in a quarterly report to Congress, but that some in the U.S. government believe we cannot prevent these same people from receiving a government contract.

You know, Taliban soldiers are a hundred times cheaper than American soldiers, Pashtoon, the member of parliament from Kandahar, said. So for a lot less money the Taliban can fight for a long time.

The military had long been reluctant to address corruption. But now General Petraeus, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, conceded that the flood of U.S. money into Afghanistan was both an opportunity and a danger. He added that, uncontrolled, it could unintentionally fuel corruption, finance insurgent networks, strengthen criminal patronage networks, and undermine our efforts in Afghanistan. Money, it seemed, was a double-edged weapons system.

The military created Task Force 2010, a team of forensic accountants, law-enforcement agents, intelligence analysts, lawyers, and auditors, to scrutinize Afghan contractors. The team reported that, of the thirty-one billion dollars in contracts that it inspected, an estimated three hundred and sixty million dollars had reached corrupt officials, criminals, or the Taliban. Thomas Creal, the lead forensic accountant on the task force, told me that U.S. taxpayer dollars reached the insurgents through a layer of intermediaries that began with the contractors. I always viewed them as an aider and abettor of terrorist acts, he said.

In 2010, as investigators descended on KAF , contractors there began to come under scrutiny. The military came in and did their audits, Castleman said. We got audited. In October, the U.S. military detained Mohmand, Tawazuhs owner, on suspicion of making payments to the Taliban. Though he was quickly released, his company was barred from receiving further contracts.

In May, 2011, Hikmat, too, was banned from receiving contracts from the military, because of allegations that he had direct association with individuals who have been involved in significant criminal activity or insurgent operations, according to a declassified report presented in court. Creal said that his team had initially flagged Hikmat because his invoices were so high. It wasnt hard to come to the conclusion that Shadman was getting way more money than he should have, Creal told me.

But Hikmats allies in the Special Forces believed that his rivals, including General Raziq Sherzai, were jealous of his success, and that the accusations were based on false information that they gave to military investigators. Some of Hiks competitors were always trying to make his life difficult, Bradley wrote. (Raziq Sherzai denied this.)

Myers told the court that he began digging deep into both sides of the allegations. After Hikmat took a polygraph test, Myers got the Bush Hogs commander to lead a successful effort to remove the ban on him. In the next six months, Hikmats companies billed TOIFOR for more than fifty million dollars.

But the military investigators had come to believe that Hikmat may have been paying off the Taliban. According to Creal, they discovered transfers from his account to an alleged Taliban money mover, who, it was rumored, was connected to a suicide bombing on KAF . Twice that year, attackers had detonated cars packed with explosives at the bases main gate, killing dozens of Afghan civilians. Around 4 A.M. on October 1, 2012, a U.S. military team raided Hikmats compound.

Hikmats first thought, when armed men kicked in his bedroom door, was that the Taliban had come for him. The men cursed him in Pashto, but when they dragged him outside he saw, to his relief, that there were American soldiers with them. He was blindfolded, shackled, and flown across the country to the main U.S. detention facility in Afghanistan, at Bagram Airfield. The way they treated me and the place they put me in the jail, Hikmat told me, his voice trailing off. It was a toilet.

In intake, he was subjected to the same fate as those he had once hunted alongside the Special Forces. His head was shaved, and he was forced to strip and wash under the guards supervision, an ordeal that Hikmat, having grown up in conservative Kandahar, found particularly humiliating. This is why President Karzai says that this is the factory of the Taliban, he said. How they treat people!

Hikmat denied any connection with the Taliban, and passed a polygraph test. In Pashto, we have a proverb that you cannot hold two watermelons in one hand, Hikmat told me. When I was fifteen, I started working with you guys. I am one of the family members of the Special Forces, and I worked against the Taliban.

According to a declaration submitted in court by Hikmats lawyers, the civilian interrogator who questioned him for two months at Bagram came to believe that he was innocent. The evidence against him was flimsy and, the interrogator suspected, provided by disgruntled former employees or business competitors who were known to be jealous and resentful of Hikmatullahs success.

At the time, Afghans detained by the U.S. military were entitled to a hearing within sixty days, at which three officers determined whether they were still a threat to U.S. and allied forces and, if not, whether they should be released. A group of Hikmats Afghan supporters approached Gul Agha Sherzai, the former governor of Kandahar, and asked for his help. Sherzai remained close to the U.S. military leadership and often intervened in support of detainees; he had already helped secure the release of Mohmand, Tuwazuhs owner.

On December 9, 2012, the day of the hearing, Sherzai arrived at Bagram, along with a group of tribal elders from Kandahar. He, too, was unimpressed by the evidence presented by the military investigators. They had no documents, Sherzai told me. Even so, he found it plausible that both Mohmand and Hikmat were paying off the Taliban, since it was a widespread practice in the trucking business. They werent powerful enough to face the Taliban, he said. Why would it be that easy for them to pass with their convoys?

With Sherzai and the Special Forces vouching for Hikmat, the three officers voted to clear him. After he was released, he flew back to Kandahar. I think it broke his spirit for a bit, Hikmats employee Franco Swart told me. In Hikmats absence, the business had largely shut down. On January 23, 2013, Hikmat flew to Dubai, and started shopping for a piece of very expensive real estate.

Since the beginning of the war, Dubai has been a magnet for Afghans seeking to move their fortunes out of the country. Hikmat told me that, since he could no longer operate on KAF , he had decided to invest in property. He settled on Ahli House Tower, a residential apartment block of approximately two hundred units. On February 23rd, he signed a contract to buy it for forty-three million dollars. But when he called his bank in Kabul he was told that his accounts had been frozen.

While Hikmat was detained at Bagram, the Justice Department, working with SIGAR , had filed a civil-forfeiture suit, claiming that Hikmat had paid bribes in order to obtain contracts. The civil route made sense, a former Justice Department official who worked on Hikmats case said. Theres no extradition agreement, no way that hed be arrested in Afghanistan. Since Hikmats bank accounts were in Kabul, the Justice Department section at the U.S. Embassy had to persuade the Afghan attorney generals office to recognize the warrant, something that had never been done before. The attorney general, Mohammad Ishaq Aloko, a Karzai protg, was out of the country undergoing medical treatment; in his absence, his deputy acquiesced.

When Hikmat returned from Dubai, on February 28th, he went straight to the attorney generals office, where he was told that he was under investigation. Later, prosecutors called him back and arrested him. He was thrown into prison for several hours, until a call came from the Presidential palace, ordering his release.

Shadmans case was a very fishy case, a former senior official in the Afghan attorney generals office said. Karzai was calling us saying, What happened with this case? The money was supposed to be released. 

Aimal Faizi, a spokesperson for Karzai, denied that Karzai had any personal interest in the case. For President Karzai, it was just another case of illegal detention of an Afghan citizen by the U.S. forces in Afghanistan, he said.

Hikmats accounts were unfrozen, and he transferred seventy-four million dollars to bank accounts in Dubai. When the Justice Department officials at the Embassy learned that the Afghan government had unblocked the accounts, they were furious. One of our people went over and confronted the attorney general about it, the former official said, telling him that he had lost a great opportunity to demonstrate to the international community the integrity of your legal system.

But Hikmat was still vulnerable. When funds targeted by a civil-forfeiture suit are held outside the reach of the U.S. government, it has the authority to seize equivalent funds held by those foreign banks in the U.S. In May, 2013, the U.S. restrained funds in the correspondent accounts of Hikmats banks in New York, forcing the banks to freeze fifty-seven million dollars of his money in Dubai and Kabul.

The civil-forfeiture suit has not yet gone to trial, and both the Justice Department and SIGAR declined to speak with me about it. Hikmats lawyers have filed reams of documents in courtincluding bank statements, depositions, and business recordsbut the government has barely outlined its case, which alleges that Hikmat paid bribes to both U.S. soldiers and TOIFOR contractors, including some of Stowells successors at the Jingle Truck Office.

Yet the Justice Department has prosecuted a series of related criminal cases in North Carolina, where Fort Bragg, the home of the Special Forces, is situated. On September 29th, five current and former Army sergeants were sentenced for taking illegal payments. Several of them wept as they spoke of their betrayal of the military and their families. If you did something that impaired the Armys fighting ability, Judge Terrence Boyle said, referring to earlier wars, they would court-martial and shoot you. He then handed down sentences that ranged from ten months to ten years. I mean, how do you explain it to somebody whose child or spouse or loved one, you know, died in one of these theatres?

Four of the soldiers had worked in the Bush Hogs logistics section in Kandahar from February, 2011, to January, 2012, Hikmats most lucrative period. According to court documents, the soldiers created fake trucking missionssome signed with names like Bongo Truck and Touchi Mehand allowed Hikmats drivers to steal fuel in return for cash payments.

These criminal cases suggest long-running fraud within the Special Forces service detachment on KAF . The lawyer for the soldiers leader, Sergeant First Class Jeffrey Edmondson, said that Edmondson learned about the scheme from his predecessor on KAF , a staff sergeant who worked for Woodall and the Desert Eagles. The prosecution stated that it was in the process of investigating that unit. (My military career is over, and Im done with that portion of my life. And thats that, the staff sergeant told me when I reached him by phone, before declining to speak further. He has not been charged.) Another soldier, Sergeant First Class Robert Green, admitted to receiving at least forty-five thousand dollars from Hikmat in 2008, and said that fraudulent practices had existed before his arrival. In exchange for a reduced sentence, he coperated with the government against his former superior, an Army captain, who recently pleaded guilty to similar charges.

This is a cycle that goes through every year, Judge Boyle said at the sentencing hearing. When the new guy shows up, they say, Well, you can get a good meal over here and you can get, you know, a beer over here, and, by the way, you can pick up a quarter of a million dollars if you feel like itwe just run this operation.

Similar cases involving fuel theft and Afghan contractors have been unearthed at other military bases in Afghanistan. Weve interviewed a lot of the people weve caught, a law-enforcement official at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul told me. One of the things they say is that the system is so loose, and its so obvious that you can get away with it.

The Armys Special Operations Command, when asked whether it was aware of systemic corruption within its logistics section on KAF , declined to comment. Its commander at the time, Lieutenant General Charles Cleveland, offered this statement to the court on the impact of the cases: The majority of the Afghan population views the United States as one more in a long line of occupiers. When people they regularly do business with, in this case the Soldiers listed above, are exposed as thieves and conspirators, the established trust and respect is destroyed.

In late December, the Justice Department filed criminal-conspiracy and bribery charges against Hikmat. A warrant was issued, though its unlikely that hell be arrested, since he spends his time in Dubai and Kabul. He and his lawyers have denied that he paid bribes or committed any illegal activities. In court hearings, Hikmats lead counsel, Bryant Banes, has said that Hikmat was paid out of logistics funds for intelligence work for the Special Forces, and that classified evidence will exonerate him. Bradley has stated that he recruited Hikmat to be part of classified compartmented programs.

Bradley, Myers, and Woodall have not been accused of any wrongdoing or criminal acts, and they remain loyal to Hikmat. Woodall, who is now a major, wrote to me, Hikmat is a friend to not only myself but to the American servicemen who operated in Afghanistan. To say differently is a disgrace.

I dont want nothing else to do with Afghanistan, Bradley told me, before refusing to comment. Everything about it gets twisted into something wrong. Myers also declined to speak. Both he and Bradley have retired from the Army. Myers has started a nonprofit, The World Is My Country Foundation. His Web campaigns have solicited funds for earthquake relief efforts in Nepal, and for him and his best friend to drive around the world, helping people in every country we drive through. According to his social-media posts, he plans to work on charitable campaigns with Hikmat in Afghanistan. The World Is My Country Foundation is registered as a nonprofit in Texas by Banes, Hikmats lawyer.

Last March, I visited Kandahar City. The fiery heat of summer was still a way off, and the air was mellow and dry. There were only ten thousand U.S. soldiers left in Afghanistan, and, compared to the mad years of the surge, Kandahar felt quiet. The long lines of trucks waiting to enter KAF had vanished, and the economy was languishing without them.

Security conditions have continued to deteriorate. In September, Taliban fighters overran Kunduz, the countrys fifth-largest city, when the government forces collapsed in a day. After two weeks of fighting, Afghan special-operations troops, backed by American airpower, retook the city. A few days later, President Obama announced that he would extend the American troop deployment, into its fifteenth year, in order to shore up the Afghan government.

Within the U.S. government, there is growing recognition that Americas vast expenditures in Afghanistan have been self-defeating, and that the conflict is more complex than simply fighting the Taliban or terrorism. The existential threat to the long-term viability of modern Afghanistan is corruption, General John Allen, the former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, told Congress in 2014.

But, in a war waged by private contracting, the line between profit and profiteering can be hard to define. In Kandahar, I was told by many Afghans that the small thieves are caught so that the big thieves may go free. They believed that Hikmat had been singled out by the Americans because he lacked the political connections of rivals like the Sherzais. Its not only Hikmatullah Shadmanthere were so many contractors that did the exact same thing that Shadman did, Khalid Pashtoon, the member of parliament, said. The only problem was that Shadman was captured. He added, Hikmat was like a milking cow: everybody tried to suck his milk.

A Kandahari businessman used a different metaphor. Hikmat was like a knight in chess, he told me. There were many people before and after Hikmat, far richer than him. He said that he owned about a hundred trucks and had subcontracted for Hikmat and the other awwal las contractors on KAF . He also claimed that he had helped to sell stolen fuel on the black market, and had delivered the cash to soldiers working with the Special Forces unit at the airport. The bottom line is the Americans were corrupt themselves.

The American money was benefitting everybodythe government and the Taliban, Gul Agha Sherzai told me. There was, he said, an apt Pashto proverb about unintended consequences: A rifle strikes from its barrel and its butt. "
"188","The Burning Garbage Heap That Choked Mumbai.txt",545,1048,60,"From above, the sprawling trash heap of Deonar (pronounced Devnar), in eastern Mumbai, resembles a large left ear. A curving stream traces its outer edge, feeding into Thane Creek, the body of water that separates the city from the Indian mainland. On the opposite side of the ear, where the head would be, is the teeming neighborhood of Shivaji Nagar. In late January, Deonar erupted in fires. An arrowhead-shaped plume of smoke floated up from the three-hundred-and-twenty-six-acre site, carried aloft by northeasterly winds, and blanketed Mumbai. For six days, the citys air-quality rating remained at very poor, with measurements of particulate matter exceeding safety standards by a factor of five. Seventy schools were closed, and hospitals were flooded with patients suffering from lung and heart ailments. (Air pollution contributes to more than six hundred thousand premature deaths in India every year.) The acrid smoke burned the eyes and throats of people from the Gateway of India, a monument at Mumbais southern tip, to Chembur, fifteen miles away, near the dump. Locals took to calling the neighborhood Gas Chembur.

Earlier this month, after the fires were mostly doused, Rishi Aggarwal and Vazir Kadri went to Deonar to see the effects of the inferno. Aggarwal is a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation Mumbai, an independent think tank, and has been an environmental activist since the late nineteen-nineties, when he protested illegal dumping in a lake near his home. I used to call it my own Walden Pool, he said, before admitting with a laugh that it was just a big ditch. Kadri lives in Shivaji Nagar with his parents, his wife, their two children, and his brothers family, all crowded into one house. His thirteen-year-old son has tuberculosis, and the symptoms worsened during the fire. My child is affected, he said, and so he is agitating to close the dump.

Gaining access to Deonar proved easy for the two men: they simply stepped through a broad breach in the barbed-wire-topped stone wall, dodging rat holes and fresh water-buffalo patties as they went. They walked past endless bits of plastic, a shiny spoon, old shoes, and deposits of construction sand, which muffled the smell. They crested peaks of detritus until, soon, they were at eye level with the minarets of a nearby mosque, looking down on the rooftops of two- and three-story buildings. Where we are standing once used to be all mangroves, Aggarwal said. When the British set up Deonar, in 1927, it was miles from the city. Over the years, though, as Mumbai grew into a metropolis of more than twelve million, the site was enveloped. Now, Kadri said, the dumping ground has become a mountain. Black flies landed on his bright white button-down shirt. The smell of smoke still filled the air, and small blazes were visible in several directions. (The Mumbai Police are investigating who set the January fire.)

There once was a plan to clean up Deonar. Years ago, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, which manages (in the loose sense of the term) the site, declared that half of it would be shut down, with systems put in place to collect methane and wastewater. But litigation and political infighting have stalled the B.M.C.s efforts. New landfill locations, beyond the bounds of the city, have been proposed by government officials, but the plans have been fought fiercely by the people living there. Its a common conundrum in India, which has a population four times larger than that of the United States in a territory about a third as big. For years, it was NIMBY Not in my back yard,  Aggarwal said. So the garbage kept coming to Deonar, more than eight million pounds daily, nearly a third of the citys waste. But now people have realized that whatever goes out of their back yard also affects them, he continued. This garbage belongs to millions of citizens in Mumbai, and the toxic air has gone back to the same residents.

Something over the next hummock caught Aggarwals eye. Come! Come! he called. In the distance, trucks were arriving, kicking up billows of golden dust, depositing new loads of refuse for bulldozers to scrape up. There were dozens of people around the vehicles, sorting through the piles. Its the treasure of ragpickers, Aggarwal said. Continuing to walk up the hill, he passed a man who was collecting coconut husks, which he would sell to a bakery for fuel. We need to look at waste not as waste but as a resource, Aggarwal said. You can have a bloody rich entrepreneur base instead of two or three big politicians benefitting from this nonsense. (In the past, officials have received kickbacks for awarding particular companies waste-disposal contracts, which are never properly fulfilled.) Aggarwal advocates for the composting of all organic matter, which is required by law but rarely enacted, and comprehensive recycling, as happens on a small scale at some community facilities. In his more optimistic moments, he envisions a circular economy in which products are designed to be useful even after their primary function is fulfilled.

For now, the recycling happens piecemeal, scrap by scrap. Another man was moving across the hills and humps of the trashscape, collecting plastic bags in a large piece of fabric with the green, white, and saffron stripes of the national flag. When the mound reached his waist, he knotted up the four corners to create a hefty bundle, his work done. He stepped to a small pool of water, black as espresso, which had collected in a depression, and leaned down to wash. He scooped up water with his hands, rubbing down his arms, his fingers, his legs. Then he slipped off his flip-flops so that he could get the spaces between his toes. Close by, a young boy was entertaining himself with a shimmering strand of unspooled cassette tape. A dog wandered by, pausing to let out a yowl. The boy responded in kind. Hundreds of feet above him, birds of prey rode the thermal currents, their wings outstretched and their forked tails tilting, in the company of plastic bags that swirled in the same winds. For the moment, a strong breeze had cleared most of the smoke from the skies of Mumbai. Within a couple of days, though, the haze would return."

"190","The FBI director at the Apple judiciary hearing gets schooled on security tech by a congressman.txt",455,1481,95,"I dont know.

I dont know if that would work.

I have no idea.

Im not sure I even fully understand the questions.

Safe to say, Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey was unprepared for a barrage of technical questions by California congressman Darrell Issa (R), during a hearing on iPhone encryption.

The House Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing today (March 1) after Apple refused to comply with a federal court order to help the FBI break into the iPhone 5c of one of the San Bernardino shooters by bypassing a security feature that erases its data after too many unsuccessful unlocking attempts. To do so, Apple said it would have to create a special version of its mobile operating system.

In his opening statement at the hearing, Comey described the FBIs request as akin to asking Apple to take away the vicious guard dog and let[ting] us pick the lock.

During his five minutes of questioning, Issa repeatedly asked if the FBI had tried other solutions before asking Apple to comply. His questions centered around whether the FBI asked Apple for the source code. Though Issa admitted he didnt know if it was possible, he suggested the government agency could use the phones source code to make copies of its memory, potentially allowing the FBI to try as many unlocking combinations as necessary without losing valuable information. This, suggested Issa, might be an alternative to compelling Apple to create a back door.

Im doing this because I came out of the security business and this befuddles me that you havent looked at the source code, and you dont really understand the disk drive, at least to answer my dumb questions if you will, Issa said. How can you come before this committee, before a federal judge, and demand that someone else invent something if you cant answer the questions that your people have tried this?

Comey tried to handle the grilling gracefully, in the end saying: Im totally open to suggestions.

The full transcript of their exchange is below:

Rep. Darrell Issa:

Justice Scalia said it best what Im going to quote, almost 30 years ago in Arizona v Hicks, in which he said: There is nothing new in the realization that the Constitution sometimes insulates the criminality of a few in order to protect the privacy of all of us. I think that stands as a viewpoint that I have to balance when asking you questions. As I understand the case and theres a lot of brilliant lawyers and experienced people that know about the All Writs Act, but what I understand is you in the case of Apple in California are demanding through a court order that Apple invent something, that they have to create something. If thats true, then my first question to you is the FBI is the premiere law enforcement organization with laboratories that are second to none in the world. Are you testifying today that you and or contractors that you employ could not achieve this without demanding an unwilling partner doing it?

FBI director James Comey:

Correct.

Issa:

And you do so because you have researched this extensively?

Comey:

Yes we worked very, very hard on this. Were never going to give up but

Issa:

Did you receive the source code from Apple? Did you demand the source code?

Comey:

Did we ask Apple for their source code? Not that Im aware of.

Issa:

So you actually couldnt hand a software person the source code saying can you modify this to do what we want if you didnt have the source code. So who did you go to, if you can tell us that you consider an expert on writing source code changes that you want Apple to do for you, you want them to invent itwho would you go to?

Comey:

Im not sure Im following the question.

Issa:

Well, Im going to assume that the burden of Apple is X. But before you get to the burden of Apple doing something it doesnt want to do because its not in its economic best interest and theyve said that they have real ethical beliefs that youre asking them to something wrong, sort of their moral fiber. You are asking them to do something and theres a burden. No question at all, they have to invent it. And Im asking you have you fully viewed the burden to the government. We spend $4.2 trillion every year. You have a multibillion dollar budget. Is the burden so high on you that you could not defeat this product either through getting the source and changing it or some other means. Are you testifying that?

Comey:

We wouldnt be litigating if we could. We engaged all parts of the government to see if does anyone have a way short of asking Apple to do this with a 5c running iOS 9 and we do not.

Issa:

Lets go through the 5c running iOS 9. Does the 5c have a nonviolatile memory in which all the encrypted data and selection switches for the phone settings are all located in that encrypted data?

Comey:

I dont know.

Issa:

Well, it does. Take my word for it for now. So that means that you can, in fact, remove from the phone all of its memory, all of its nonvolatile memory, its disk drive if you will, and set it over here and have a true copy of it to conduct infinite number of attacks on. Lets assume that you make an infinite number of copies once you have one copy, right?

Comey:

I have no idea.

Issa:

Lets go through what you asked. Im doing this because I came out of the security business and this befuddles me that you havent looked at the source code, and you dont really understand the disk drive, at least to answer my dumb questions if you will. Theres only a memory and that memorythat non-violatile memory sits hereand theres a chip, and the chip does have an encryption code that was burned into it. And you can make 10,000 copies of this chip, this non-violatile memory hard drive, then you can perform the attacks as you want on it.

Now you asked specifically Apple to defeat the finger code so you can attack it automatically so you dont have to punch in codes. Youve asked them to eliminate the 10 [attempts] and destroy. But you havent asked, as far as I know, asked them, OK if we make a thousand copies or two thousand copies of this and we put it with the chip and we run five tries, 00 through 04, and throw that image away and put another one in and do that 2,000 times, wont we have tried with a non-changing chip and an encryption code that is duplicated 2,000 times? Wont we have tried all 10,000 possible combinations in a matter of hours? If you havent asked that question, the question is: How can you come before this committee before a federal judge and demand that someone else invent something if you cant answer the questions that your people have tried this?

Comey:

First, Im the director of the FBI. If I could answer that question, there would be something dysfunctional in the leadership.

Issa:

I only asked if your people had done these things. I didnt ask if that would work. I dont know if that would work. I asked you who did you go to, did you get the source code, have you asked these questions because youre expecting somebody to obey an order they dont want to do and you havent even figured out whether you can do it yourself. You just told us well we cant do it but you didnt ask for the source code and you didnt ask the questions I asked here today and Im just a guy 

[cut off because time for questioning expired]

Comey:

I did not ask the questions youre asking me here today. Im not sure I even fully understand the questions. I have reasonable confidence, in fact I have high confidence that all elements of the US government focused on this problem, and Ive had great conversations with Apple. Apple has never suggested to us theres another way to do it other than what theyve been asked to do in the All Writs Act. It could be when the Apple representative testifies youll ask him and well have some great breakthrough, but I dont think so. But Im totally open to suggestions. Lots of people have emailed ideas, Ive heard about mirroring and maybe this is what youre talking about. We havent figured it out, but Im hoping my folks are watching this and if youve said something that makes good sense to them, well jump on it and well let you know."
"191","The fight between Apple and the FBI moves to Capitol Hill.txt",488,1049,53,"The heated dispute over the FBI effort to force Apple to help unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers moved Tuesday to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers appear deeply divided on the issue.

FBI Director James B. Comey and Apples general counsel, Bruce Sewell, both testified at a crowded House Judiciary Committee hearing on encryption and the balance between privacy and national security.

Comey warned that public safety may suffer if Apple and other Silicon Valley companies can defy court-ordered warrants to cooperate with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies.

Join the conversation on Facebook >>

If there are warrant-proof spaces in American life, what does that mean? And what are the consequences of that? Comey asked.

Comey denied Sewell's claim that the FBI is asking for a ""backdoor"" key to open Apple devices, insisting the California case is focused only on a single iPhone 5c.



There is already a door on the iPhone,"" he said, referred to the encrypted password. ""We are asking Apple to take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock.""



The FBI wants Apple to write software that would turn off a security feature designed to wipe out data if 10 incorrect attempts are made to enter the password. Once those settings are disabled, the FBI would then try passwords until the phone unlocks.



The hearing convened a day after Apple won a major federal court ruling in New York, a ruling that could affect the San Bernardino case, as well as potential legislation in Congress.

In Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein said he did not have the authority to order Apple to disable security on a iPhone used by a drug dealer who had pleaded guilty in a methamphetamine distribution case.

Across the country in Riverside, Apple is fighting U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym's order to write software so FBI technicians can unlock a work phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook. He and his wife killed 14 people on Dec. 2 at the Inland Regional Center.

It's unclear if any useful evidence exists on Farook's phone. The FBI insists it might hold clues to the couple's location, contacts and communications before the attack.

The debate has created unusual alliances in Congress, as libertarian Republicans have lined up with civil liberties Democrats to support Apple stand on privacy.

But it also has aligned national security hawks in both parties, who warn that law enforcement will be blocked from accessing evidence in terrorism and criminal cases unless high tech companies are forced to cooperate.

The divide was clear from the start of Tuesday's hearing when Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he once led efforts to prevent law enforcement from getting a backdoor key to commercial encryption, allowing U.S. companies to thrive and keep the market from heading overseas.



But now, he said, the use of stronger encryption and other new tech tools ""by those intending harm to the American people is outpacing law enforcement's technological capability to access those communications in legitimate criminal and national security investigations.""



We must find a way for physical security not to be at odds with information security, Goodlatte said. Law enforcement must be able to fight crime and keep us safe, and this countrys innovative companies must at the same time have the opportunity to offer secure services to keep our customers safe.""



The question over how to balance privacy and security is too complex to be left to the courts and must be answered by Congress, Goodlatte said.



But the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), warned that the FBI may be using the San Bernardino case to win public sympathy and change the law.



I would be deeply disappointed if it turns out that the government is found to be exploiting a national tragedy to pursue a change in the law, he said.



This case appears to be little more than an end run around this committee,"" Conyers said.



In testimony submitted before Tuesday's hearing, Sewell argued that the FBI is ""asking for a back door into the iPhone  specifically to build a software tool that can break the encryption system which protects personal information on every iPhone.

Weakening encryption, he said, ""will only hurt consumers and other well-meaning users who rely on companies like Apple to protect their personal information.""

In court papers, Justice Department lawyers have argued that they are asking Apple to write software only for the one phone, not for all iPhones, and that the company would still control the software, not the government.

Manhattan Dist. Atty. Cyrus Vance Jr., who also will testify at the hearing, said in a statement submitted to the committee that his office has 175 Apple devices in its forensics lab that investigators can't open.

It is important to recognize that 95% of all criminal prosecutions in this country are handled at the state and local level, and that Apples switch to default encryption in the fall of 2014 severely harms many of these prosecutions, Vance wrote.

Vance has given lawmakers proposed legislation that would require companies to design their products so police and prosecutors can read locked data subject to a search warrant.

Lawmakers are split over whether the government should be able to force tech companies to weaken security features meant to protect customers' private data.

A bill being drafted by Sen. Richard M. Burr (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the panel's top Democrat, would penalize companies that don't comply with court orders to help authorities crack encrypted devices.

""No one's above the law in this country; no company, no individual, no organization,"" Feinstein said last week after Apple said it would fight the court order. ""All the FBI is asking them to do is cooperate and do their best to help.""

Apple supports a competing proposal that would create a blue-ribbon commission to study encryption and privacy concerns, and then make recommendations to Congress.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, introduced a bill Monday to create the National Commission on Digital Security.

Busby Berkeley, justly famous for his spectacularly choreographed and ingeniously photographed musical production numbers, rose to a very specific occasionthe Second World Warto become, much to anyones surprise, one of the great artists of the particularly hectic wartime spirit. This occurred in two films, the first of which, For Me and My Gal, from 1942, I discuss in this clip. (The other is The Gangs All Here.) For that matter, when it comes to figuring out just what that wartime state of mind is, these two Berkeley films are prime examples. They take their place among the most advanced of wartime art, which was both modernist and abstract; for instance, bebop and Abstract Expressionism were forged on the home front in the early nineteen-forties.

Berkeley may have filmed stories about war, but they werent documentarieshe was in Hollywood. Life on the home front, spent pursuing such apparent frivolities as song and dance, was his very subject, and in For Me and My Gal he reveals just how hectic and tormented, beneath the patriotic pomp, that home-front life was. For this film, Berkeley worked under unusual circumstances: supervised by the iron-willed producer Arthur Freed, he was barred from creating any production numbers in his familiar styles. On the other hand, Berkeley had the benefit of an exceptionally gifted pair of lead actors, Gene Kelly (in his first movie) and Judy Garland (who, at twenty, had her first full romantic leading role). In lieu of creating kaleidoscopic complexities on the set to conjure philosophical abstractions regarding his obsessive themes of sex and society, Berkeley found and stoked those inner tangles and whirls of ideas and emotions in the performances of his stars. He had, in earlier films of lesser dramatic import, tuned his exquisite cinematographic style to the performances of his actors. Now, with For Me and My Gal, he acquired both a tone and a theme that expanded that dramatic vision into a world view of historic scope."

Attorney Ed Perry also tells The Associated Press that James Austin Hancock's family wants the families of those hurt and the Madison Local Schools community in general to know that they are very concerned and saddened about them. They declined to talk with reporters Tuesday morning outside the juvenile courtroom where Perry entered a denial of charges including attempted murder for Hancock.

He says it's been difficult to get the youth to talk with him, but he says he hopes that will change in the days ahead. Hancock is being held in juvenile detention pending an April 5 hearing.

A 14-year-old boy accused of shooting students in an Ohio school cafeteria has denied charges including attempted murder.

An attorney for James Austin Hancock entered the juvenile court equivalent of a not guilty plea on Tuesday, a day after police say the teen opened fire during lunch and shot two students.

Hancock is charged with attempted murder, felonious assault, inducing panic and making terroristic threats.

He also repeated that authorities also believe they know a motive in the Monday lunchtime shooting, but aren't releasing any details to avoid jeopardizing the case.

Jones says as terrifying as the shooting was, it's a relief that no lives were lost. He says it's the first school shooting in memory in Butler County in southwest Ohio, although there have been repeated school lockdowns because of threats in recent months.

He calls on school officials throughout the counties to recognize that such shootings can happen anywhere, and to take action to be sure their schools are protected.

The youth's attorney denied the charges Tuesday in juvenile court.

In eight of nine states where exit polls were conducted Tuesday, Democratic voters were more likely to want a continuation of President Barack Obama's policies than a switch to more liberal policies.

According to early results of the exit polls conducted for the Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research, majorities of Democratic voters in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia want a continuation of Obama's policies, along with more than 4 in 10 voters in Arkansas, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Texas.

In each of those states, about a third of Democratic voters or less want a switch to more liberal policies.

In Vermont, about half of Democratic primary voters said they want the next president to change to more liberal policies.

Large majorities of Republican primary voters across nine states have negative feelings toward the federal government.

But whether they're more dissatisfied or more angry varies by state.

According to early results of exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research, at least 8 in 10 GOP primary voters in each state feel down on the way the federal government is working.

The dissatisfied outnumbered the angry and accounted for a half or more of Republican voters in Virginia, Vermont and Massachusetts.

In Texas, half of GOP primary voters said they were angry.

In Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma and Tennessee, GOP voters were more evenly split between dissatisfaction and anger.

White voters accounted for half of voters or less in three of nine Democratic primaries where exit polls were conducted on Super Tuesday.

According to early results of exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks, nearly half of Democratic primary voters in Alabama and Georgia were black.

In Texas, about 3 in 10 Democratic primary voters were Hispanic and a little under 2 in 10 were black.

In three other states, black voters accounted for about a quarter of Democratic primary voters. They are Virginia, Arkansas and Tennessee.

Large majorities of Republican primary voters in six states going to the polls on Super Tuesday said they support a proposal to temporarily ban all non-citizen Muslims from entering the United States.

Early results of exit polls conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks show two-thirds of GOP primary voters in Texas, Virginia and Georgia, 7 in 10 in Tennessee, and nearly 8 in 10 in Alabama support the proposal championed by GOP front-runner Donald Trump.

But Republican voters were more divided on another major immigration issue, whether to deport immigrants already in the country illegally or allow them to stay.

In just one of the seven states where the question was asked, Alabama, did a majority of Republicans support deportation. In two states, Virginia and Georgia, those who preferred legal status outnumbered those supporting deportation.

Marco Rubio is ceremonially launching his campaign for the must-win primary in Florida, where Donald Trump sits comfortably ahead.

The Florida senator is telling reporters in Minnesota that he is looking ahead to the March 15 contest in his home state because he will have ""a lot of delegates"" after Super Tuesday balloting in 11 states holding Republican contests, even if he doesn't win any states. And he's predicting that the competition will become so fierce that it will become clear that Trump ""has no chance"" of ever winning enough delegates to capture the GOP presidential nomination.

Rubio also is setting high expectations for Ted Cruz's Super Tuesday finish. Cruz is doing well but not likely to win all 155 delegates offered by the contest in his home state of Texas.

Rubio says, ""Tonight was supposed to be Ted Cruz's big night."""

"196","The New Yorker.txt",462,842,57,"Four days before the Academy Awards, Russell Simmonss new-media company, All Def Digital, hosted its own movie-awards show, a D.I.Y. response to the #OscarsSoWhite campaign. We were watching the controversy around the Oscars unfold, and it occurred to us that every Wednesday night, yards away from where the Oscars are held, we run a standup-comedy night, Sanjay Sharma, All Def Digitals president, said last week. Tony Rock, a younger brother of Chris Rock (this years Oscar host), emcees. The first thought was to do an Oscars-themed night, but that quickly snowballed and took on a life of its own.

Sharma and his team put together the awards show in ten days, after making a quick deal with the Fusion network to air it opposite the Academy Awards. All Defs standup show is usually held at Graumans Chinese Theatre, on Hollywood Boulevard, but Academy Awards-related street closures forced them to relocate to a Hollywood night club called Lure. At 7 P.M. on Wednesday, camera crews set up along a stretch of carpetblack, at Simmonss request, rather than red.

As guests arrived, Simmons, in shirtsleeves and a purple bow tie, maneuvered around tables and plastic chairs. Well-wishers thumped him on the back. He explained that he wasnt against the Oscars. I just think they needed what Jada saidon Twitter, Jada Pinkett Smith had lamented the absence of black nominees in top categories. Sometimes a little pressure makes diamonds. I love Hollywood, I love what were doing in Hollywood, and I want it to be better.

At nine oclock, the comedian Gary (G-Thang) Johnson arrived onstage and implored attendees to take their seats. If your outfit shouldnt be on TV, sit in the back, he bellowed. Drakes Back to Back boomed from the speakers, and Snoop Dogg hopped onstage to dance. Nick Cannon, in a suit of what looked like gray snakeskin, slapped hands with the model Amber Rose. Its all family, Cannon said, smiling. Its like a family reunion.

Tony Rock presided over the ceremony in a black suit and Adidas. A big-screen TV served as a teleprompter. Regina Hall, presenting the first award, for Best Actress, said, I didnt write this, so I dont know if Im gonna be able to make it land. (The scripted joke suggested that Americas first female President should model herself on Suge Knight, the rap mogul who is currently in jail.)

There were thirteen categories, and the nominees spanned decades of moviemaking. Contenders for Best Helpful White Person included Michelle Pfeiffer, in Dangerous Minds, and Christoph Waltz, in Django Unchained. Waltz won. Robin Thicke accepted the award, a golden statue of a pimp, on behalf of all white people. Five Reparation Awards were given, for being just black enough to still be castable, to Vin Diesel, Luis Guzman, Jackie Chan, Angela Bassett, and Dwayne Johnson. When a highlight reel of menacing film villains (category: Best Bad Muh Fucka) cut out, Terry Crews, who was presenting the award, threw up his hands: Man, this is ghetto as hell. Im falling asleep, the publicist Peggy Siegal, sitting with some reporters at Table Ten, said.

During breaks for to-be-inserted commercials, guests flocked to the bar. Were having a good time, J. B. Smoove, who had on aviator sunglasses and stayed seated with his wife, said. Everybodys here. Were here, networking, connecting. You know, youve got to start somewhere. Were going to be in a better place in a year or two. He went on, Youve got to spark something to end something, thats my motto. He made his hands into fists and then opened them wide. Whoo!

Staffers at All Def Digital had contrived the awards categories, nominees, and winners, with the exception of the Best Picture and Most Quoted Movie categories, whose winners were decided by online voters. The former was the only category whose entrants (Beasts of No Nation, Chi-Raq, Concussion, Creed, Dope, and Straight Outta Compton) were all in theatres last year. Straight Outta Compton won, and Ice Cube, one of the films producers, accepted the award, then made a beeline for a waiting car.

When the show was over, Simmons seemed happy. I think it went very well, he said. Imagine, we need to cut it to forty minutes. We have eight hours of footage.

At the after party, Tony Rock propped his three-year-old niece on a banquette to dance. I wanted her to see this so that, when shes older and she hears about how Hollywood used to be selective in hiring, shell be, like, Really? 

Snoop Dogg held court in a V.I.P. section. This awards show was so relaxing, so fun. Its what an awards show is supposed to be, he said. A lot of times, you see people be so stiff, they dont really get a chance to enjoy themselves because of so many rules and regulations. He sat in a booth, wearing a cardigan sweater and puffing on a blunt. Ive never been to the Oscars, but I feel like they need new blood in there. They need people that are hip. "
"197","The next frontier for school safety_ The cafeteria.txt",368,933,52,"About 100 school administrators across Los Angeles County gathered to learn about school safety on Monday. About the same time, authorities said a 14-year-old in Ohio opened fire on his cafeteria.

The location is telling.

School shootings are on the rise. There were 38 school shootings in 2013 compared with 64 last year. And the cafeteria is now considered one of the most dangerous places for a school shooting. Theyre noisy, crowded spaces that can be hard for kids to escape, and for teachers to control, said Dennis Lewis, the founder of Edu-Safe, a school safety consulting company.

Cafeterias the worst-case scenario, Lewis said in an interview after Mondays training in Downey, where he and co-consultant Judy Brunner taught the group how to prevent and react to bomb threats and active-shooter scenarios. Lewis previously directed school safety in Missouri.

After Columbine, the 1999 massacre in which a pair of students killed 13 people and injured dozens more at Columbine High School in Colorado, schools began to take the threat of an assailant more seriously. Schools across the country now have intruder and lockdown plans in place, and some conduct active-shooter drills to prepare students and teachers.

Teachers and administrators around L.A. know to close classroom doors and keep children inside, with the blinds closed and lights off, when necessary.

But what if students are outside the classroom when a shooter pulls a gun?

Los Angeles Unified School Districts lockdown policy, for example, calls for students who are outside to be moved to the nearest room that can be locked, and for students in a cafeteria to be kept there. It doesnt mention what to do if a shooter is inside the cafeteria along with students.

Lewis didnt know about the Ohio shooting while the Downey training was in session, but he and Brunner spoke during an interview afterward about how schools can better prepare and react to a threat when students arent in the classroom:

1. Prepare ahead of time

The day an assailant appears on campus shouldnt be the first time a school implements its active-shooter plan, and both teachers and students should know what to do.

Lewis and Brunner suggest teaching the active-shooter and lockdown plan as part of the curriculum at the beginning of the year, with age-appropriate language.

For the younger kids, youre talking about running from danger, Lewis said.

If students are outside, schools can establish safe sites where children and teachers can meet; depending on the scenario, that could be the edge of campus or a nearby park. Schools should tell teachers that if theyre outside and unable to get into a locked classroom, they should run with the students to one of those sites. Its a good idea to walk the routes with students early in the year, Lewis said.

2. One-word commands

Even if these reunification sites are set up, it can be difficult to get students attention in playgrounds or outdoor areas. Teachers should tell their students to recognize one word to react to when they hear it. For example, a teacher should just have to scream, Run! on a playground to get students attention and lead the way to the nearest safe site.

If a shooting occurs on a school bus, for example, the bus driver should be trained to yell, Down! and the students should know that means to hide under their seats because theres a dangerous situation, Lewis said.

3. Give teachers and students options

Students near an exit when an active shooter enters the cafeteria should try to use it. If they cant do that, they should try to find a place to hide. In a cafeteria, that could include a crawl space under a stage, a storage room for tables or behind a wall or partition, if possible. Both Lewis and Brunner said they couldnt comment directly on the Ohio shooting.

There are too many variables to create a standard procedure for cafeteria shootings, said Timothy J. Anderson, a deputy chief with the Los Angeles School Police Department. Instead, school police try to train administrators and staff to think clearly as humanly possible and to be able to make sound decisions, he said. He echoed Lewis advice: Staff and students can escape the room if possible and find cover if its not possible to get out.

Lewis said schools should give students directions for survival at the beginning of the year when training them, so that they feel prepared.

The same goes for teachers and administrators: Depending on the situation, an adult close to the shooter might try to take the assailant down when he or she pauses to reload, or might try to get as many students outside as possible if farther away.

There are countless scenarios involving shooters, and are almost impossible to prevent; still, its statistically unlikely that any one school will face a shooter on campus, Lewis said.

He admits that not all schools should adopt his plan; parents might object to talking about shootings or school danger with young children. And even with a plan in place, it would be difficult to keep track of children who are running to a designated meeting spot off campus and for them to remember those meeting spots during an emergency situation.

But local schools are thinking about these possibilities more as the threats feel closer to their districts, L.A. County Supt. Arturo Delgado said. School administrators requested the training after the December shooting in San Bernardino, which prompted a districtwide school lockdown, and after L.A. Unifieds recent decision to close its schools following a potential bomb threat."
"198","The Night Crawlers.txt",732,1546,72,"Im always somewhat surprised to discover how many of the writers and thinkers Ive admired over the years grew up reading Eugene ONeill with a passion equal to my own. For years, I thought of ONeill, who spoke so deeply to my adolescent self, as a kind of private pleasure. So I experienced something of a jolt when, in 2006, Joan Didion told me, during an interview, that as a girl shed read all ONeills works in one summer, captivated by his theatricality. Mike Nichols, in a 2016 PBS American Masters program, described how much ONeill meant to him, too. What impressed me, as I watched Didions and Nicholss eyes light up at the thought of those maddening sexist, racist, restless, complicated, and important dramas, was how little either of them had in common stylistically with ONeills raw imperfections. And yet they responded to his narratives in their souls, as did I. ONeills words made me feel that working with your imagination was a noble calling somehow, and that any kind of story could work onstage if you strongly believed it belonged there. Even when reading his mystifyingly bad works, such as The Fountain (written 1921-22) or Lazarus Laughed (1926) or Dynamo (1928), I was in ONeills corner, fascinated by the way he illuminated his invented worlds with hysteria.

Of course, my interest in the art was inseparable from my interest in the artistthat melancholy boy with Black Irish looks, who grew up in a drama of his own. His father, James, was the headliner, a ham actor, whose matine-idol posturing and self-delusion prompted his brilliant son to run away and cook up a new kind of realismfuelled by European-influenced ideas about angst and hopped up on the American vernacular. And then there was the high drama that his mother, Mary Ellen, a morphine addict, indulged in. ONeills beloved older brother, James, Jr., or Jamie, inherited both forms of helplessness. An alcoholic sometime actor, he died in 1923, at the age of forty-five, but his depression, his wry humor, and his anguished relationship with his mother live on in a number of ONeills characters, including James Tyrone, Jr., in A Moon for the Misbegotten (1941-43) and Long Days Journey Into Night (1941-42).

In 1942, while working on those masterpieces, ONeill also wrote his last one-act play, Hughie (in revival at the Booth, under the noteworthy direction of Michael Grandage). It was a period of personal turmoil. The playwright was fifty-three; his career was in decline. (From 1934 to 1946, ONeill had no new plays produced.) In the midst of the war, writing seemed to him a trivial activity, the commercial theatre meaningless. More or less estranged from his childrenhe had no real gift for intimacy, just a near-obsessive drive to be close to women hed rejected or whod rejected himONeill was also beginning to show signs of the brain disorder that led to his death, in 1953, at sixty-five. Nevertheless, Hughie signalled an upswing in his artistic life. This hour-long song was intended to be one in a series of eight one-act plays, titled By Way of Obit, in each of which a character would tell another about someone who had died. Via this monologue, you get a complete picture of the person who has diedhis or her whole life storybut just as complete a picture of . . . the narrator, ONeill said. And you also get, by another meansuse of stage directions, mostlyan insight into the whole life of the person who does little but listen.

And listen the Night Clerk doeseven before Erie Smith (Forest Whitaker) enters and starts talking about Hughie, who preceded the Night Clerk in his job. Sitting on a stool, facing the audience, the Night Clerk (played by Frank Wood, who is immense in a constricted part) stares acquiescently at nothing and listens. We hear what he seems to be listening to, not for: the car horns and footfalls of midtown Manhattan in 1928. Its approaching 4 A.M. , what James Baldwin called the devastating hour: the day is indisputably over; almost instantaneously, a new day begins, and how will one bear it? The Night Clerk bears it by letting sound, atmosphere, time run through him like sand through an hourglass.

Erie bears it in another way. Our first sight of him tells us everything, or everything he wants his audience to know, which is how he treats the worldas spectators, potential pals he needs to win over in order to feel right in his mind. Entering through a heavy door, upstage center, Erie is tall, with rounded shoulders and a slightly shambling walk; he looks as though he were caving in on himself while trying to remain upright, spiritually and otherwise. We recognize him, or ourselves, in his effort to be sprightly, upbeatto make life something other than what it iseven, or especially, in places like this dark, sad hotel lobby, which might as well be on the edge of the world. (Christopher Oram and Neil Austin, who have done a mighty job with the set and the lighting, respectively, have made the lobby look like a way station, the next-to-last stop before the elevator to the gallows.)

Catching sight of the new Night Clerk, Erie smiles a broader smileits part of his maskand introduces himself. Hes been on a drunk precipitated by Hughies death, he says. Now the alcohol is wearing off, and perhaps reality is settling in just a little, and Erie stands at the center of what Hughie is about (in addition to ONeills nostalgia for the slang of the era): how you can be held captive by the guilt you feel at being alive. In any case, Erie is delighted that the hotel has replaced the young squirt they took on when Hughie got sick. One of them fresh wise punks. Couldnt tell him nothing. Its probably fair to assume that that clerk put up a wall against Eries verbiage, and that Erie didnt take the rejection well. Now hes been given another chance to talk, to win a guy over and maybe love him, just as he loved Hughie, who was his anchor in a sea of booze and loneliness. When the Night Clerk mentions that his last name is Hughesas was HughiesErie gets excited, but then the Night Clerk points out that they werent related. No, thats right, Erie replies. He continues:

Hughie told me he didnt have no relations leftexcept his wife and kids, of course. Yeah. The poor guy croaked last week. His funeral was what started me off on a bat. Some drunk! I dont go on one often. Its bum dope in my book. A guy gets careless and gabs about things he knows and when he comes to hes liable to find theres guys whod feel easier if he wasnt around no more. Thats the trouble with knowing things.

That last sentence, such an honest response to ones own consciousness, slays us in the way that only ONeill can; its subjectivity, its credibility remake the world for us, framing it with a proscenium and peopling it with Whitaker and Wood. Together and separately, theyre more than fine actors; theyre poets equal to ONeills poeticism. But this appreciation may be delayed. In fact, I wasnt sure what I thought of the show until a few days after Id seen it. Perhaps, while watching, I was on guard against the possibility of ONeills occasional mawkishness interfacing with Whitakers. But later, closing my eyes, I remembered Whitakers light-colored suit and his gracefulness, which works in counterpoint to his outsized frame. For years, I didnt respond to Whitaker as much as I wanted to. In film after film, he played what I called Negro yearning: he was always on the outside looking in, especially at love. At times, this stance felt to me like special pleading. And I wasnt sure about his authenticity. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Whitaker didnt eschew sentimentality; in fact, he often hid behind it. Neil Jordan tempered that tendency in The Crying Game (1992), not by casting Whitaker against type but by making his typehis sensitivity and awkwardnessseem sexy to his transsexual partner. In Panic Room (2002), David Fincher revealed how attractive Whitaker could be when his performance as a thug had hints of melancholia and tenderheartedness without being subsumed by them. But in other films, such as A Rage in Harlem (1991) and Bird (1988), in which he starred as the jazz legend Charlie Parker, there was too much hazy nostalgia for Whitakers softness to sink into. He was a junkie Teddy bear. Grandage, like Jordan and Fincher, emphasizes whats most interesting about Whitakerhis emotional accessibility, his curiosity about his own pain and that of the society that surrounds himbut he doesnt make Erie a nostalgic figure. Theres critical distance here; Erie is a white character played by a black man, and the complications inherent in that casting keep the production contemporary and important.

Nothing significant happens in Hughie except theatreand the creative lives of its actors. As Erie stands beside his new hope, the Night Clerk, while bent low, internally, by grief, Whitaker may remind you of Charles Laughton, another actor who was uncertain in his body and made a style out of trying to mask it, too.

"199","The scenes of a crime_ Kota Ezawa revisits the Gardner Museum theft.txt",175,242,15,"We should be bored with Kota Ezawa by now. For more than a decade, the Japanese German artist has reduced familiar photographs and videos to arrangements of flat, simple shapes. Everything he does looks like a Flash animation from the late '90s, yet Ezawa always finds a way to make this technique seem, if not new, then relevant.

His latest exhibition at Christopher Grimes looks at the unsolved 1990 theft of $500 million in artwork from Bostons Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. It is surprisingly emotional.

For the first time, Ezawa applies his signature style to paintings and three-dimensional objects, creating scale images of each of the 13 stolen artworks. Displayed salon style in lightboxes on the wall, they include works by Rembrandt, Vermeer and Degas, as well as a Napoleonic flagpole finial and a Chinese vase.

Glowing faintly, the abstracted images appear to hover on the wall. These ghost works are clearly not replicas, but they look just enough like the originals to evoke what has been lost. The public may never see these masterpieces again; Ezawas work becomes a kind of memorial.

Accompanying this tableau is a black-and-white two-channel video. It is based on security footage released by the museum in hopes of identifying the thieves. Here, Ezawas reductive technique eclipses that possibility, but it reminds us just how little we know about what really happened.

"200","The schoolboy wrongly accused of two murders.txt",1127,4188,269,"Image copyright Remand /Revolution Pictures

Ugandan schoolboy Tumusiime Henry was 15 when he was accused of murder the first time. While he waited almost two years for the trial to begin he was accused of a second murder. But then he met an American lawyer who slowly realised it was up to him to come to the rescue of an innocent teenager.

Henry was at school when the men came for him. They were not wearing uniforms, so he did not realise at first that it was the police, but then they pulled out the handcuffs. ""I was like, 'My God, what's this?'"" he says. He and his younger brother, Joseph, were bundled into a police van and were shocked to find their mother inside.

""Just be calm. God will help out,"" she said.

A few days earlier, a calamity had befallen the family. Henry's father had been saving money to pay for his education. In addition to the income from their small farm, the family had glued together envelopes and sold them for a few pennies, while Henry's mother had cooked chapattis for village restaurants. The hope was that Henry, always top of his class, would be the first in the family to go to university.

But then the money vanished from under the mattress, and along with it Imanriho, a man who had worked on the farm as a herdsman for many years.

In Uganda they arrest first and then they investigate later

It was not long before someone from the village spotted the culprit at the market in the nearby town of Hoima, and dragged him back to account for the missing money. A mob set upon him. Henry heard the commotion at school, but did not know what it was about and was not allowed out. His father, however, rushed to the scene and tried to stop the attack. ""Enough! Let me get him some water,"" he cried. But at that moment someone dropped a huge stone that crushed Imanriho's head.

The crowd dispersed, leaving Henry's father with the dead body. He had been a part of the family, even if he had run away with their savings. He decided to bury him in his field.

It was this that led the whole family to be arrested on suspicion of murder.

""In Uganda they arrest first and then they investigate later,"" says Henry. The two boys - aged 15 and 13 - were locked up in Hoima jail with their father, although their mother was released.

After two months in the adult jail, Henry and Joseph were sent to a juvenile remand centre in Ihungu, about 50km (30 miles) away.

The single concrete dormitory block was dark and overcrowded, with just a few sleeping mats on the floor. There was no fence, but there were many rules in place to prevent escape. The brothers had to give up their shirt and shoes and were kept apart. One of the teenagers acted as leader and was given the title of ""katikkiro"" - which means ""prime minister"" - it was their job to enforce the rules and punishments.

The group of 20-odd young people were meant to be looked after by a matron called Rose Mpairwe, but she broke the rules and sent them out to work illegally in the fields.

Henry soon found out what happened when you broke her rules. Walking to work on the first day he carried his hoe on his shoulder - this was forbidden. ""I took it down but they had already seen me, so I got a beating,"" he says.

The teenagers would start work at 6am and weren't fed until after they got back at 11am. Henry and his brother were not used to such hard labour. ""We had no experience of digging at that pace. If we lagged behind, we would get less porridge,"" he says.

The warden in charge of the remand centre was unaware of what the matron was up to and nobody dared to tell him. ""I had a fear - so I couldn't express myself fully,"" says Henry.

Still, the brothers settled in and after a while the warden appointed Henry prime minister. He took his duties seriously. ""I struggled to lift up the voices of any fellow prisoners who were not listened to,"" he says.

And being prime minister made life more bearable. ""I got relief from beating and I was allowed full access to my brother.""

Towards the end of 2009 some new boys arrived. One of them, called Innocent, was in a bad way - he had asthma, and had already spent three days in a police station without any medicine. He also had cuts on his hands from being tied up.

""I had a clue that he was sick - he worked slowly,"" says Henry. ""Rose wasn't happy with that. She really wanted to make him work."" Henry explained to her that Innocent was sick, but she didn't believe him. ""He really couldn't lift the hoe,"" says Henry.

The matron ordered Henry to beat Innocent. When he protested, she slapped him and warned him that he would lose his position as prime minister. The thought of losing access to his brother was too awful - Henry felt he had no choice.

""I gave him a few strokes to impress Rose, but she wasn't satisfied,"" he says. In fact, his lenience angered her further, and she then made the boys bury Innocent up to his neck. This distressed everyone so much that he was quickly dug up again.

Innocent was then given lighter duties - clearing a piece of ground which was going to be dug up the next day. He saw a chance to escape, and seized it. Henry was sent to chase the sick child. ""I easily got him and brought him back,"" he says.

To punish Innocent for his escape attempt, Mpairwe ordered four of the newcomers to give him 10 strokes each with the cane - 40 in all. ""Innocent couldn't scream by that time, he was really suffering,"" says Henry. ""He asked for water, she said no. No-one moved - we did not dare to take him water. Rose was the controller of everything.""

Obviously unwell, Innocent was taken back to the remand centre by motorbike - the others followed on foot. Henry was told to take him to hospital, but by the time he reached the dormitory, it was too late. ""I called Innocent, but there was no reply. I went close to his bed. It was all dark. Innocent was dead,"" he says.

Henry was deeply upset. ""This was my fellow prisoner,"" he says. ""What should I do?""

When Henry told the warden what had happened, he tried to reassure him. ""You have nothing to worry about, I believe in you,"" he said. But Henry was not so sure.

When the police came the next day, they arrested the matron but, as prime minister Henry was also held responsible.

Eighteen months after being taken from his classroom, he was now charged with two murders and began to feel he would never be released.

""I told my mum not to come and visit me again,"" Henry says, ""because I had really lost hope by that time.""

Then in January 2010 some American lawyers arrived in Ihungu. One of them was Jim Gash, a law professor at Pepperdine University in California. The university's law school had developed a close relationship with the Ugandan judiciary, providing free training and sending students over to volunteer during the summer vacation.

I had kids that age and I was just thinking - this is not OK with me Jim Gash , Lawyer

It was the first time Gash had been to Uganda. After hearing reports of young people left languishing for long periods in an ""up-country"" remand centre, his team planned to spend a week preparing the teenagers' defence cases so that they could finally be brought to trial.

""I was a 'volun-tourist',"" he says. ""I thought this was going to be a one-time thing."" He had no idea how deeply involved he would get.

""When I walked in I was just shocked and emotionally shaken because there is no electricity, no running water, no beds - there were just thin mats on the floor, with slits in the upper part of the wall [for ventilation] with no mosquito nets, and the kids were just in a hopeless state of disrepair clothing-wise,"" says Gash.

""I had kids that age and I was just thinking: 'This is not OK with me, somebody's got to do something about that - but at the time I didn't think it was going to be me.'""

The team had not brought a translator, but when they arrived in Ihungu they discovered that only two of the 21 prisoners spoke English: Henry and his younger brother Joseph.

The Americans split into two groups - Joseph helped one team, while Henry was assigned to translate for Gash.

""We walked him through what kind of information we needed and he acted like he understood completely,"" says Gash. ""And over time we realised he did, because he's really smart.""

Henry spoke five languages but sometimes even that wasn't enough. ""There was one kid who spoke a language that only one other kid spoke, so I would ask Henry in English and then he would interpret into this other language and then that boy would interpret into the native language of the defendant,"" says Gash.

Some of the teenagers didn't even know what they were charged with. Others admitted their misdemeanours. Several were there because they'd had sex with their girlfriends before the girls had reached the age of 18. There were some tragic stories.

""One boy confessed to stealing a gun in order to kill himself,"" says Gash. ""He was a member of the Lango tribe in an area where this tribe wasn't accepted and his parents had died a few years earlier. Even when we were with him, he was quite despondent.""

Another girl had given birth to a sick baby and was accused of murder when it died.

To corroborate their statements, the lawyers also paid for witnesses to travel to the remand centre. One man made his own way, walking for seven hours to give his statement.

Eventually Gash turned his attention to Henry. Before arriving in Ihungu the Americans had been nervous about meeting this boy accused of two murders, but he was nothing like what they expected. ""He's a little guy - he's 5ft 4in (162cm) and weighs about 120lb (55kg) - so I didn't feel physically in danger, but nevertheless it was an odd situation,"" says Gash.

While he spoke to Henry, Joseph was interviewed by the other team. Their stories matched exactly. Both said they were in school when the mob attacked, and that no-one had been allowed to leave.

The lawyers then called the headmaster, who confirmed the story. ""When the mob rushed by the school we shut everything down - I went into every single classroom and made sure the teachers knew that no-one is allowed to leave,"" he told them. The lock-down had begun at 9am and it wasn't until the end of the school day, long after the mob had dispersed, that anyone was allowed out.

Image copyright Jim Gash/Divine Collision Image caption Jim Gash with Henry and Joseph in the remand centre

""There was no question in our mind, these kids are being held unjustly,"" says Gash.

By then, he and Henry had begun to bond. ""He's a strong person of faith as well,"" says Gash, a devout Christian. ""But more than anything it was: this kid needs help.""

It wasn't all work. Between interviews, the lawyers would chat and play football with the boys. During one such break Gash showed Henry his mobile phone. ""Yours is better than mine,"" said Henry, and took out his. Gash was astounded that he had one, but Henry was still the prime minister, responsible for his fellow prisoners, and needed to be able to call for help if anyone got sick or hurt.

Then Henry held up Gash's business card and asked if that was the number for his mobile phone. It wasn't, but at that point, Gash decided to go the extra mile - he gave Henry his mobile phone number and promised to stay in touch.

When he landed back in the US, he switched on his phone to hear the message: ""Hello Mr Jim, this is Henry. I hope you had a safe journey, thank you for coming to see us.""

Since then, the two have spoken every week.

Image copyright Remand/Revolution Pictures Image caption Henry was lonely when he returned to the remand home

Two months later, in March 2010, both of Henry's cases - and those of his fellow prisoners - went to court. In Uganda, groups of up to 40 cases are scheduled at the same time for efficiency - that way if witnesses haven't appeared for one trial, the court can get on with the next one.

The first charge - the killing of Imanriho - was dismissed immediately. Henry's father and brother were free to go, but Henry had to return to the remand centre until the conclusion of his other trial, on the charge of murdering Innocent.

He felt lonely - not only was his brother gone but 17 of his fellow prisoners had also been released.

Several were found not guilty and released, but many of them pleaded guilty to the offences because the punishment that they would receive was shorter than the time that had already been served.

For his second trial Henry shared a lawyer with his co-accused, the matron, Mpairwe.

Worryingly, while at court, Henry's father had seen one of her witnesses accept a bribe, while being told to put the blame on Henry.

More worrying still was the defence lawyer's strategy - because Henry was only 17, he could get no more than three years for a capital offence, so the lawyer decided to focus on defending his other client, who faced the maximum penalty.

""The lawyer told me not to defend myself and told Rose to defend herself,"" says Henry. ""I was really confused. I was trusting him as my lawyer but I was very concerned.""

Back in the US, Gash listened to these developments with increasing frustration.

It then turned out that the lawyer intended to lay all the blame on Henry - it was her word against his. No witnesses were called to defend him, and he himself was not asked to testify.

On the day of the verdict, 22 April 2010, the court found both parties guilty of murder. Mpairwe was sentenced to 10 years. Henry's sentence depended on a medical examination to prove that he was a minor. If he was found to be an adult, he could face the maximum penalty: death.

""That's when I got on the next plane,"" says Gash. ""I didn't know what I was going to do, but I knew somebody I cared about was in great distress.""

Birth records in Uganda are not always reliable, so courts ask doctors to determine the age of a defendant. Henry had been examined twice already, but this time the court said he had to be seen by a police doctor.

Image copyright Jim Gash/Divine Collision Image caption Henry and Jim have grown close

This made Gash nervous, because of the possibility of corruption.

""Corruption is an issue,"" he says. ""It's not as big at higher levels, like the High Court and above, because they are sufficiently compensated - but in the police it's a huge problem because they're so poorly paid that they supplement their income.""

Henry's family had no money to bribe anybody, and would not have been willing to stoop to it, Gash says, ""or they could have been out a long time ago"".

Gash waited anxiously while Henry was taken back to his home town to be examined.

""That was one of the most tense times in my entire life,"" he says. ""If the other doctor said he was 18, getting a death penalty, or getting a sentence of 25 or 30 years, was a very real possibility.""

Image copyright Jan Banning Image caption Inmates in Luzira maximum security prison - those in white are on death row

One man who knows a lot about the death penalty in Uganda is Edward Mpagi.

His 18 years on death row in Kampala's maximum security Luzira prison ended before Henry was even arrested but their cases have much in common.

Both began with a theft. Mpagi's neighbour, William Wandyaka, was robbed and because their families were embroiled in a long-running dispute over land, suspicion fell on Mpagi.

Again, the whole family was arrested - Mpagi, his cousin Fred Masembe, and their parents - although the parents were soon released.

The two young men spent a year on remand in the local prison during which time they only met their lawyer twice. When Mpagi stood before the High Court judge, he was horrified to hear that the charge was murder, not robbery. He didn't even know that anyone was supposed to have died.

""It was terrible,"" says Mpagi. ""Because if you are innocent you have no words to say.""

Image copyright Scott Langley Image caption Edward Mpagi was condemned to death for a murder that never even happened

Mpagi watched as four people testified falsely that they had seen him with a gun. Like Henry, no witnesses were called for his defence.

The truth was that not only was there no gun, there was no victim. Wandyaka was alive and well, and had simply gone into hiding. ""He was staying very far from home, just coming home at night - he couldn't expose himself,"" says Mpagi.

The ""murder"" had been faked to settle a score. ""In our culture, if somebody attacks your children it hurts you very much. That's what they did,"" says Mpagi.

Mpagi and his cousin were sentenced to death and taken straight to Luzira, where the death row cells were meant for one man but housed four or five. ""We would share a small bucket as a chamber pot. And we used to have diarrhoea, because of dysentery. It was terrible,"" says Mpagi. Inmates were only allowed out of their cells for half an hour a day, to empty the buckets.

Masembe fell ill with asthma and diarrhoea but was refused treatment and died in 1985.

Mpagi outlived not only his cousin, but also about 180 other men who died of diseases such as dysentery, cholera and TB - and the much smaller number who were actually executed.

The last hanging of civilians took place in 1999, when a group of 28 prisoners were taken out to die.

Before that, there were five other executions, of three to nine prisoners each, between 1989 and 1996.

Mpagi heard every one from his cell.

""We could hear them crying, saying farewell to us,"" he says.

As in Henry's case, a foreigner tried to help. In this case an Italian priest went to Mpagi's village and verified that his ""victim"" was still alive. A group of 90 villagers wrote to the attorney general to confirm that no murder had taken place, but years passed before he finally received a presidential pardon.

Released in 2000, Mpagi started visiting Luzira as a Catholic preacher, to provide comfort to prisoners. He still visits death row every week and says the situation there is improving, with prisoners now taking part in educational activities.

Image copyright Remand/Revolution Pictures

In 2005 the constitutional court of Uganda also ruled that long delays in carrying out executions amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, so now any prisoners held on death row for three years have their sentences commuted to life.

One thing hasn't changed though, Mpagi says. ""Most prisoners do not have lawyers and still need somebody to follow up on their cases.""

And Uganda is still sentencing people to death, even if the sentence is not being carried out.

Image copyright Scott Langley Image caption Since his release Mpagi has remarried and set up a school for children of prisoners

Compared with Mpagi, and many others, Henry was lucky.

The police doctor confirmed that he was under 18, which meant he was sentenced to a year's probation by a juvenile court. He had already served twice that, so he was released immediately.

His two years on remand had been full of anguish and hard to endure, but many Ugandans have to wait longer for their trial - an average of five years.

This causes innumerable problems. ""By the time the case comes up, witnesses either have died or relocated and are no longer interested in testifying,"" says the director of public prosecutions, Mike Chibita.

It also means Uganda's prisons are hugely overcrowded. Luzira prison, with a capacity for 600, houses more than 2,500 prisoners, more than half of them are on remand.

To tackle the huge backlog of cases a new idea is being piloted - a form of plea bargaining. Prisoners can volunteer to plead guilty in return for a reduced sentence. No witnesses need to be called, so court cases can be concluded in an hour rather than the usual three months. It also means witnesses can't be bribed.

""Corruption is always an issue, but less so in plea bargaining,"" says Chibita. He believes that clearing the case backlog will give overwhelmed courts time to concentrate on those prisoners who continue to protest their innocence and result in fairer trials.

Image copyright Jan Banning Image caption The Ugandan justice system is overwhelmed - these are files at a magistrate's court

The idea of plea bargaining was originally suggested by two students from Pepperdine in 2009 and when Gash was in Uganda to prepare Henry's pre-sentencing report it was raised again, by a High Court judge. ""What can we do to ensure there are no more Henrys?"" he asked Gash.

Gash later moved to Uganda for six months to help implement the new system. This meant he was able to visit Henry, who was back at school and doing well. But it bothered Gash that Henry had a criminal record. He knew this would affect his future, and wanted to appeal.

Then he discovered there was a provision in Ugandan law that allowed visiting lawyers to act for a client, as long as they were supported by a Ugandan lawyer. It had only been done once before, with a lawyer from Kenya.

Image copyright Jim Gash/Divine Collision Image caption Henry with his appeal lawyers, Edward Sekabanja and Jim Gash

On 12 March 2013 Henry's case was heard at the Court of Appeal. Gash represented him and became the first American lawyer ever to plead a case in a Ugandan court. Then, they had to wait.

""In Uganda you can spend a long period of time waiting for justice,"" says Henry.

In 2014 Henry fulfilled his greatest dream when he was admitted to university in Kampala to study medicine, though his father did not live to see it - he had died of liver cancer just months before.

Two years after the appeal, on 19 June 2015, Gash received a copy of the verdict by email, after it had been read in open court. The conviction was quashed - the court found that Henry had not had a fair hearing, and also ruled out a retrial.

Image copyright Jim Gash Image caption The moment Jim read out the verdict to Henry via Skype

He immediately called Henry via Skype and read the verdict out to him, in a shaky voice. ""You are a free man - you are exonerated. All of the charges against you have been dismissed.""

""I want to extend my appreciation for having been represented by a very good, perfect lawyer,"" said a beaming Henry.

Gash replied: ""I had a very good client to representsomeone who was innocent and needed to be proven innocent.""

""When Jim cleared my name, oh God, I was really happy. I was overwhelmed. I can't express my happiness when my name was totally cleared,"" says Henry, who is now 22.

Gash has written a book about Henry's case, and his role in it, called Divine Collision. ""Henry's life had been transformed,"" he writes. ""Because of his case, Uganda's criminal justice system was being transformed. And I was transformed.""

"201","The sudden intensity of Indonesia's anti-gay onslaught.txt",445,938,49,"Media caption Indonesia LGBT stories: ""I am a target. I am beaten""

A few short weeks in Indonesia has seen a former communications minister make a call for the public to kill any gay people they find and the leading psychiatric body describe transgenderism as a mental disorder. BBC Indonesian's Rebecca Henschke and Ging Ginanjar went to find out about the insecurity of life on the receiving end of such threats and hostility.

The swiftness and intensity of the attacks against Indonesia's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community has taken its members by surprise.

A hair salon run by transgender people in Jakarta is one place to get a sense of what it has been like. For Anggun, 23, who works there, it was enough of a struggle to accept who she really was. She is trying to stay safe by not attracting attention to herself.

""We don't know why smart people are suddenly saying things like 'homosexuality is a virus that can spread'. Even uneducated people know that's not true,"" she says.

Not every trans person in Indonesia has the chance to lead a legitimate life and career. As it is, many are forced into sex work and already face violence.

Image caption Vina and Anggun are two members of Indonesia's LGBT community who run a salon in Jakarta

Homosexuality and gay sex are not illegal in Indonesia, and the world's largest Muslim country has a vibrant transgender culture and tradition, which broadly meets with tolerance from the Indonesian public.

But something has happened in recent weeks and it is difficult to identify why it has snowballed.

Image copyright AFP

On the main street of Indonesian university town Yogyakarta last week 100 men could be found standing carrying signs that read ""LGBT is a disease"". Just a few hundred metres away a group of rights activists battled it out with the police: ""Stop attacks on democracy and threats against minorities!""

It came after the minister of research, technology and higher education, Muhammad Nasir, heard some LGBT support groups were offering counselling services at one of Indonesia's leading universities and declared they were corrupting the country's youth. The conservative media and the country's active social media users joined in the attacks.

Image caption Anti-LGBT activists held a protest in February in Yogyakarta

Image caption LGBT activists say the community should be protected under Indonesia's constitution

There followed a wave of critical statements from senior members of Indonesia's government.

One of the most extreme views came from Defence Minister, Ryamizard Ryacudu who described the movement for gay rights in Indonesia as a form of a modern warfare - an attempt by Western nations to undermine the country's sovereignty. Then former communications minister Tifatul Sembiring made a call on Twitter, where he has more than one million followers, for the public to kill any gay people that they find.

Even Indonesia's Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, called for funding to be cut to a United Nations programme that focuses on ending stigma, discrimination and violence towards LGBT people.

""What is most worrying is that they want to fight for equal marriage rights,"" he said.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Mr Kalla is known to be an outspoken figure in Indonesian politics

Rights activists insist their requests are modest and they are not demanding matrimonial rights.

But then Indonesia's top psychiatric association issued their statement: ""We need to promote, prevent, cure and rehabilitate LGBT people"". It did little to assuage fears.

Gay rights activist, Hartoyo, who runs the support group Our Voice, says the community is on high alert.

Image caption Hartoyo says he is scared of violence against the LGBT community

""I am scared that there will be violence against us. There is a history of violence against minorities in Indonesia that were fuelled by similar kinds of statements. We need the government to protect us and the president needs to say you can't talk to us like this.""

The anti-LGBT campaign also succeeded in shutting down the world's first and only Islamic school for transgender women, opened in 2008 as a safe place for transgender people to learn about their Islamic faith and pray together.

Many gay people are able to live comfortably and without prejudice particularly in the capital Jakarta, as long as they don't draw attention to their sexuality.

And across Indonesia the picture is complex. The Bugis tribe in Sulawesi, for example, recognises five genders, including bissu- someone who is neither a man nor a woman.

Leading human rights lawyer, Todung Mulya Lubis, argues that the community is protected under the country's secular constitution but is concerned that elements of conservative Islam are becoming increasingly vocal in Indonesia's pluralistic society.

""What upsets me,"" adds Lubis, ""is that the president hasn't stepped into the debate"".

Image caption LGBT activists say the community should be protected under Indonesia's constitution

The LGBT community in Indonesia openly campaigned for Joko Widodo hoping that his presidency would bring in a new era of greater tolerance.

While the president hasn't made any direct statements, his close aide, Luhut Panjitan, coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, has.

Speaking in parliament recently, he said: ""[LGBT] might not be 'normal' in terms of the general rules and religion but you can't just dismiss them like that,"" he said.

""We have to remember that all of us also could have a relative or an offspring that is LGBT. They are part of our communities and citizens of our country and they too have to be protected.""

Many observers remain sceptical that such statements will be able to stem the rising tide of officially-endorsed intolerance."

"205","This Week in Fiction_ Fiona McFarlane on the Power of Beauty Withheld.txt",309,622,31,"Your story in this weeks issue, Buttony, involves a childrens game in which a button is hidden in a players hands. Is it a game youve played, or was it invented for the story?

I read about the game in a book called Paraphernalia: The Curious Lives of Magical Things, by Steven Connor. I have no memory of playing Buttony, but it felt so uncannily familiar that I put the book down and started writing the story. Perhaps I did play it as a child. But it may be that I was simply reacting to the strange ritualistic way in which the game plays out so many childhood fearsof rejection, of being overlooked or lied to or tricked.

One of the children, Joseph, is described as a kind of golden boy. The other childrenand even his teacherlook up to him and are fascinated by him. Where does his power over others come from?

Josephs power arises from his beauty, which he complicates by withholdinghe hides it behind long hair, he moves slowly, he accepts everybody but seeks nobody out. The children perceive him as kind; it may be that hes simply indifferent. Joseph is the effortlessly cool kid, the one who seems years older than the others, the one with the great hairand, because the story isnt strictly realistic, hes that kid, but amplified.

In the course of the game, Joseph does something sly that defeats the other childrens expectations. Is it a joke, an experiment, or actually, as they seem to experience it, a betrayal?

The children do experience Josephs behavior as a betrayal, but they dont turn on him for ittheir anger and bewilderment are directed at anything and anyone but Joseph. It may be that he acts as he does in order to exercise his power, but his motives are unclear to his teacher, Miss Lewis, who provides the storys point of view.

The teacher, Miss Lewis, wants her students (whom she thinks of as her children) to live in a heightened way. Its an unusual thought for a teacher of young children to have, and it leads to a situation that is more overwrought than heightened. Do you think she has what most people would consider an appropriate approach to teaching?

Miss Lewis reveres beauty in a way that she wants to pass on to her children, and there are versions of this that might benefit them: a love of language, or art, or the elegance of mathematics. Unfortunately, its Josephs form of beauty shes fixated on: unearned, specifically male, powerful, and not necessarily benign. She likes to see this beauty worshipped, and she likes to punish it. She also underestimates it.

Buttony will appear in your forthcoming story collection, The High Places (which also includes Art Appreciation, a story of yours that came out in The New Yorker, in 2013). How long have you been working on stories for the book? Are the stories thematically linked in any way?

The oldest story in the bookwhich involves lost boys and an enormous shopping-mall Christmas treewas written in 2004; Buttony is the newest. I wrote the stories over a period of ten years, before, during, and after I wrote my novel The Night Guest. The stories arent linked in any specific way, but its been interesting to gather them together into a collection and track fascinations and preoccupations: children, belief, artifice, animals (especially birds, but also one very colossal squid), Sydney (my home town), memory, and anxiety. Im interested in Australianness and how its been fashionedthe influence of the United States, for example, during the Second World War and afterward. And, most of all, Im drawn to those moments when people do things that are mysterious even to themselves."
"206","Three faint Super Tuesday hopes for anti-Trump Republicans.txt",234,397,16,"Donald Trump is expected to dominate Republican primary voting today, but thanks to a fractured field, Super Tuesday doesnt have the potential to be as decisive as the Democratic equivalent.

If the polls hold true and Trump continues to ride a heady combination of white identity politics and economic nationalism to victory, conservative #NeverTrump true-believers can look to a few signs to convince them that its not too late to rally behind a viable alternate for the GOP nomination.

Cruz re-enacts the Alamo

One thing is clear: The Republican establishment hates Texas senator Ted Cruz almost as much as they hate Trump. To their delight, his campaign has been floundering since he underperformed in South Carolina, which seemed tailor-made for his coalition of evangelicals and Tea Party liberty voters. That result and a tie in Nevada has cast doubts on his overall campaign, underscoring his dependence on todays primaries in many southern states.

But Trump haters shouldnt be rooting for a Cruz collapse. They need him to win his home state of Texas to help hold off Trump, who has been closing in on the states delegate bonanza. Its sort of an Alamo scenario: Anti-Trump forces will lose the battle today but win the greater war, thanks to Cruzs valiant but ultimately suicidal last stand to defend the Lone Star state.

Rubio gains traction

The number one hope for #NeverTrump: Some combination of Trumps KKK flirtation, Republican endorsements of Marco Rubio, and Rubios transformation into an insult comic will allow him to exceed polling expectations. Besides garnering delegates in big states like Georgia and Texas, any sign that he can build an anti-Trump coalitionespecially among college-educated voterswould be a big win.

Most importantly, it will boost the pressure on other candidates to drop out ahead of crucial votes on March 15particularly in Rubios home state of Florida and the Republican bellwether of Ohiothat will likely decide the nominee.

Kasich (and Carson) drop out

Ohio Governor John Kasich seems intent on staying in until his state votes in the middle of March, but the number-crunchers fear that a delay in winnowing the field will allow Trump to build an insurmountable lead of delegates in the early contests. Any conservative hoping that Trump isnt the Republican nominee had best hope Kasich, with his determined if outdated pitch of compassionate conservatism, and Carson, the doddering physician, take the hint soon."

"208","Trump claims 7 GOP victories, extending dominance.txt",347,651,35,"MIAMI (AP)  Donald Trump claimed seven Republican victories on Super Tuesday as the New York businessman extended his dominance in the 2016 primary.

At the same time, the GOP leaders' search for any viable alternative to Trump suffered a fresh setback, with both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio vowing to fight on despite underwhelming performances on the biggest day of voting so far. Cruz avoided disaster by winning his home state of Texas and neighboring Oklahoma, while Rubio scored a lone victory in Minnesota.

Shrugging off a racially charged feud from earlier in the week, a confident Trump looked ahead to the general election in a victory speech at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida: ""We're going to be more inclusive,"" he declared. ""We're going to be more unified.""

Voting continued in Alaska.

Trump scored victories in Georgia, Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Massachusetts and Vermont, tightening his grasp on his party's nomination on a Super Tuesday marked by panic from Republican leaders.

Fearing Trump may build an insurmountable delegate lead, top Republican officials lashed out at the billionaire businessman's command of the issues and ""seeming ambivalence"" over white supremacists as voting began.

View gallery Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., gestures as he speaks to a rally in Okl 

Trump's aggressive plans for Muslims and immigrants have resonated with Tuesday's Republican electorate, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks. Large majorities of Republican primary voters in six states, for example, said they support Trump's proposal to temporarily ban all non-citizen Muslims from entering the United States.

The results followed a wild prelude to Super Tuesday that featured extraordinary criticism from several Republican governors and senators who refused to say whether they would support their party's front-runner should Trump win the nomination.

Trump's strong performance across much of the South was a blow to Cruz, who had long expected the South to be his firewall.

Yet Cruz seized on Rubio's struggles, calling on the GOP to unify behind his candidacy, ""the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat and that will beat Donald Trump.""

With a win in Minnesota, Rubio hoped to stay competitive in the delegate count while eyeing a win in his home state of Florida on March 15.

View gallery Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks at a rally Monday, Feb. 29, 2016, 

A defiant Rubio told a hometown crowd in Miami that he had only begun to attack Trump: ""You see, just five days ago we began to unmask the true nature of the front-runner so far in this race,"" he said, calling the GOP front-runner ""a con artist.""

Ohio Gov. John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson remain in the race, but neither is expected to be a major factor on Super Tuesday.

Trump won at least 192 delegates in Tuesday's contests. Cruz collected at least 132 and Rubio picked up at least 66. John Kasich has won at least 19 delegates and Ben Carson has won at least three.

Overall, Trump leads with 274 delegates. Cruz has 148, Rubio has 82, Kasich has 25 and Carson has eight.

It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president.

Envisioning a Trump White House, the front-runner said he would get along ""great with Congress,"" despite Tuesday criticism from House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who condemned his Sunday refusal to disavow the backing of a former Ku Klux Klan leader. Trump has since disavowed the nod.

""Paul Ryan, I don't know him well, but I'm sure I'm going to get along great with him,"" Trump said. ""And if I don't, he's going to have to pay a big price, OK?""

"209","Trump Derailed by Obamas Endorsement.txt",163,253,10,"WASHINGTON (Satire from The Borowitz Report)Adding a new wrinkle in an already unpredictable election year, Donald Trump saw his poll numbers plummet on Monday after receiving a surprise endorsement from President Barack Obama.

The long-awaited downfall of the abrasive billionaire came in startling fashion, as few had expected the President to offer a full-throated endorsement of Trump, especially on the eve of the all-important Super Tuesday primaries.

Praising the Republican front-runner during a nationally televised address, the President said that, despite media reports to the contrary, Trump shared his views on such important issues as immigration and religious tolerance. In every way that matters, Donald and I are on exactly the same page, Obama said, pointing to a framed picture of the billionaire on his Oval Office desk.

Concluding his endorsement with an emphatic closing argument, Obama said, If you love me, vote for Trump.

In several G.O.P. polls taken after the Presidents stunning endorsement, Trump sank from first to fifth place, trailing the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson by several points.

As news of the Presidents endorsement spread, former Trump supporters across the nation gathered to vent their anger, with some burning signs, trucker hats, and other campaign paraphernalia at impromptu bonfires.

Harland Dorrinson, who had attended a massive Trump rally in Alabama just a day earlier, said that he now felt totally betrayed by the billionaire. I guess when all is said and done, Donald Trump was just too good to be true, he said.

"210","Trump, Clinton look set for big wins on Super Tuesday.txt",468,931,47,"By Steve Holland and Amanda Becker

WASHINGTON/AUGUSTA, Ga. (Reuters) - Donald Trump looked poised to strengthen his lead in the Republican presidential race when 11 states vote on Tuesday, an outcome likely to intensify concerns among party leaders who consider him a usurper.

In the Democratic race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would go a long way toward cementing her path to the nomination if she scores big victories of her own over democratic socialist Bernie Sanders on Super Tuesday.

Opinion polls showed Trump leading in nearly all the states that will hold primary contests or caucuses, many of them in the South. The exception appeared to be Texas, the home state of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, who enjoyed a narrow lead and was in desperate need of a victory.

Super Tuesday is the biggest single day of state-by-state contests to select party nominees for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Voting stretches from eastern states to Texas and Minnesota, with the first polls closing at 7 p.m. EST (midnight GMT) in Vermont, Virginia and Georgia and first results expected soon after.

Trump has stunned many in the Republican establishment with proposals such as building a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico, deporting 11 million illegal immigrants and slapping a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.

But while his campaign has confounded many Republican leaders, the New York billionaire cites his high poll numbers as proof he is not dividing the party but expanding its ranks. He preached unity as he looked beyond Tuesday's voting to campaign in Ohio, which votes on March 15.

""Our country is so unbelievably divided,"" Trump told a rally in a Columbus plane hangar. ""We're going to bring it together. People don't know that about me - I bring people together.""

Earlier, he told ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" ""We're getting people into the party we've never had before. We're getting Democrats coming in, we're getting independents coming.""

The former reality TV star, who fires up crowds with withering mockery of his rivals and critics, faced heavy criticism this week over his failure to reject white supremacists' support during a CNN interview on Sunday.

Trump later disavowed that support, saying he had not heard the questions properly, but his explanations failed to satisfy many.

View gallery A woman (L) receives instructions before she votes in Super Tuesday elections at the Wilson School i 

""If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there must be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry,"" House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in Washington on Tuesday. He did not mention Trump by name but his target was clear.

With a string of victories on Tuesday, Trump would advance his strong lead over Cruz, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Ohio Governor John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

Voting with his wife in Houston, Cruz said he hoped Republicans would see a narrower field emerge on Wednesday. ""For any candidate that wakes up tomorrow morning who hasn't won any states ... I think it's time to start thinking about coming together and unifying and presenting a clear choice,"" he said.

Kasich and Carson have won scant support in early contests. Rubio saw increased support among Republican voters after a strong debate performance last week during which he took off the gloves against Trump. A Reuters-Ipsos poll showed support for Rubio on 20 percent, up from 14 percent, with Trump still ahead with 42 percent support.

REPUBLICAN UNEASE

View gallery An early morning voter walks into St. Lukes United Methodist Church to cast their vote in Oklahoma C 

Even as Trump advances, many Republican Party leaders do not support his positions and believe he would be easily defeated in November by Clinton if she becomes the Democratic nominee.

The crossfire between Trump and establishment Republicans threatens to rip the party apart at a time when it will need to generate momentum behind a prospective nominee. That worries some Republican strategists looking ahead to the nominating convention in July.

""If Trump continues winning, disappointed party elites will need to reconcile with supporting the party nominee,"" said Tim Albrecht, a Republican strategist in Iowa.

Trump has never run for office previously and has based his outsider appeal on the message that his success as an entrepreneur qualifies him for the White House. That has laid him open to close scrutiny of his businesses, including criticism by rivals such as Rubio of his for-profit education program Trump University.

In a development that could provide more fuel for such critics, a New York appeals court ruling on Tuesday will allow a fraud claim against Trump University by New York's attorney general to proceed. The Trump Organization's general counsel, Alan Garten, said the ruling would be appealed, and called the case politically motivated.

On the Democratic side, polls show Clinton, who has won three of the first four Democratic contests, with a big lead in six Southern states that have large blocs of black voters, who have been slow to warm to Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.

Sanders has been aiming for wins in five other states on Tuesday - Vermont, neighboring Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Minnesota and Colorado.

Sportscaster and TV host Erin Andrews testified during a civil trial Tuesday that she does not think she will ever get over the emotional fallout after a stalker secretly took nude videos of her and put them on the Internet. (March 1)

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)  Sportscaster and TV host Erin Andrews testified Tuesday that her career has thrived since a stalker took nude videos of her and posted them on the Internet, but she doesn't think she'll ever get over the emotional fallout.

Andrews has been on the witness stand for two days, often giving tearful testimony about the fear and suffering she has gone through as a result of the stalking and the videos.

She has filed a $75 million lawsuit against her stalker and the owner and operator of the Nashville Marriott at Vanderbilt. The hotel is a franchise.

Jurors will have to determine whether the companies share some of the blame after stalker Michael David Barrett altered a peephole in her hotel room in September 2008 to shoot the secret video footage. They also will have to determine how much Andrews suffered emotionally as a result.

A defense attorney for the companies told Andrews that they both agreed she was a victim of a crime. But during cross-examination, attorney Marc Dedman asked her about her career success since she discovered in July 2009 that someone put the secretly shot videos of her online.

Andrews acknowledged that she has moved on to Fox Sports, making more money than she did at ESPN and is now hosting the show ""Dancing With the Stars.""

View gallery Sportscaster and television host Erin Andrews testifies Tuesday, March 1, 2016, in Nashville, Tenn. 

Dedman noted that, in addition, Andrews has endorsed Reebok, Degree antiperspirant, Florida orange juice and a slew of other companies, as well as appeared in a commercial for Victoria Secret  one where she was fully clothed  and worked the red carpet and hosted the CMT Awards.

""You have done very well in your career since 2009?"" Dedman asked.

""Yes,"" Andrews replied.

Andrews said she has thrown herself into her career just to feel normal but remains anxious and depressed. She also said it ripped her apart when some in the media thought the nude videos were part of a publicity stunt before Barrett was arrested.

Barrett was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison after he admitted to stalking Andrews in three different cities, altering hotel room peepholes and shooting nude videos of her in Nashville and Columbus, Ohio.

View gallery Sportscaster and television host Erin Andrews walks back to her seat after giving testimony Tuesday, 

Barrett testified Monday, in a videotaped deposition, that he removed the hotel door peepholes and altered them so he could pull them out easily to place his cellphone up to the empty hole and shoot videos.

She also talked about her reluctance to date after the videos were posted and her relationship with boyfriend Jarret Stoll, a professional hockey player who plays for the Minnesota Wild.

""I feel sad because I think he would have loved the girl more who was there before this happened,"" Andrews said tearfully. ""And I feel guilty about that.""

She said to this day she remains on guard every time she stays in a hotel during her extensive business travels.

When she checks in, she immediately asks to change rooms in the hotel, she said. She said she refuses to let anyone inside the room, and sweeps it for cameras and ""booby traps.""

She said she is taunted daily about the videos, which are still online. She also testified that she fears that she will have children who will one day come home and say that other kids have seen the nude images.

The defense presented an ESPN executive, who testified via video that he did not notice any problems with her work after the discovery of the nude videos. In fact, Patrick Donaher, who was senior director of talent, planning and development for the network while Andrews was there, said she did a good job covering games and improved before she left for Fox in 2012.

Jurors must decide how Barrett came to be placed next to her room in the hotel. She maintains that the hotel honored a request of his to be put in an adjacent or conjoining room but never told her about it. The defense maintains that Barrett schemed his way into getting into the room."

"213","U.N. delays vote on tough new North Korea sanctions at Russia's request.txt",394,818,36,"By Louis Charbonneau and Michelle Nichols

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution to dramatically expand sanctions on North Korea after its recent nuclear test and satellite launch has been delayed to Wednesday after Russia negotiated changes in the U.S.-Chinese drafted text.

Last week the United States presented the 15-nation council with the draft resolution that would significantly tighten restrictions after the Jan. 6 nuclear test and Feb. 7 rocket launch, to create what it described as the toughest U.N. sanctions regime in two decades.

The vote, first scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, is now planned for 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) on Wednesday, the council said.

The U.S. mission to the United Nations said in a statement the vote was rescheduled after ""Russia invoked a procedural 24-hour review of the resolution.""

Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters ""it's a resolution which is necessary, which the Security Council needs to adopt because of the certain challenges coming from DPRK (North Korea).""

""We did have a few issues to take care of and we discussed them with the U.S. delegation and I think they accommodated some of our concerns,"" he said. ""Have they accommodated all of our concerns? Not entirely.""

After nearly two months of bilateral negotiations that at one point involved U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, China agreed to support the unusually tough measures intended to persuade its close ally North Korea to abandon its atomic weapons program.

North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 because of its four nuclear tests and multiple rocket launches.

The expanded sanctions, if adopted, would require inspections of all cargo going to and from North Korea and blacklisting North Koreans active in Syria, Iran and Vietnam.

Washington had wanted the council to adopt the resolution last weekend but Russia demanded more time to study it.

The draft, seen by Reuters, would require U.N. member states to conduct mandatory inspections of all cargo passing through their territory to or from North Korea to look for illicit goods. Previously states only had to do this if they had reasonable grounds to believe there was illicit cargo.

The list of explicitly banned luxury goods will be expanded to include luxury watches, aquatic recreational vehicles, snowmobiles worth more than $2,000, lead crystal items and recreational sports equipment.

Pyongyang denied the Feb. 7 launch involved banned ballistic missile technology, saying it was a peaceful satellite launch.

The official North Korean news agency KCNA said in a commentary on Monday its ""position as a satellite manufacturer and launcher will never change (and) ... space development is not something to be given up because of someone's 'sanctions'.""

It called the proposed sanctions ""a wanton infringement on (North Korea's) sovereignty and grave challenge to it.""

The proposal would also close a gap in the U.N. arms embargo on Pyongyang by banning all weapons imports and exports.

There would also be an unprecedented ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could directly contribute to the operational capabilities of its armed forces, such as trucks that could be modified for military purposes.

Other proposed measures include a ban on all supplies of aviation and rocket fuel to North Korea, a requirement for states to expel North Korean diplomats engaging in illicit activities, and blacklisting 16 North Korean individuals and 12 entities, including the National Aerospace Development Agency, or NADA, the body responsible for February's rocket launch.

Candidates for the blacklist include a senior official in North Korea's long-range missile program, senior officials at NADA, officials for Tanchon Commercial Bank in Syria and Vietnam, and Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (KOMID) representatives in Iran and Syria.

The previous draft would have blacklisted 17 individuals but the proposed designation of a KOMID representative in Russia was dropped from the latest version.

""He's not even in Russia, that's the problem,"" Churkin said. ""That's why we were surprised he appeared in the first place.""

There is also an exception for transshipments of Russian coal via the North Korean port of Rajin. In 2013 Russia reopened a railway link with North Korea, from the Russian eastern border town of Khasan to Rajin, to export coal and import goods from South Korea and other Asian countries.

There is also an exemption on the ban on aviation fuel to allow foreign civilian passenger airlines to travel to and from North Korea.

In addition to NADA, North Korean entities to be blacklisted include the Academy of National Defense Sciences, Chongchongang Shipping Co and the Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry.

Also new, countries will be required, not just encouraged, to freeze the assets of North Korean entities linked to Pyongyang's nuclear or missile programs and to prohibit the opening of new branches or offices of North Korean banks or to engage in banking correspondence with them.

i toggle caption John Stillwell/AFP/Getty Images John Stillwell/AFP/Getty Images

The badge denoting a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, the star worn by Knights of the Order of the Bath and other famous British medals are slated to be produced in France next year  a decision that has brought criticism from Britons who don't want their country's highest honors made on foreign soil.

In an online poll set up by The Telegraph to ask readers about the French-made military and civilian medals, the majority  84 percent of some 1,300 votes  say it's an outrage.

The story was first reported by The Times, which noted that ""the Queen will soon be pinning medals that have been made in France on the chests of military heroes, distinguished diplomats and deserving citizens.""

French company Arthus Bertrand, which already produces medals for some of France's top honors, received a contract to make 20 medals for the U.K. government after a bidding process that, as required by European Union rules, doesn't allow discrimination against foreign suppliers.

The French company was selected along with several British firms. In response to the news, a representative said that Arthus Bertrand is proud to win the contract and is awaiting its first order.

Reaction to the unprecedented decision has been particularly strong among members of the Conservative Party, including Minister of Parliament Bob Stewart, a holder of the Distinguished Service Order.

""Can you imagine the French allowing the Lgion d'honneur to be made in Germany?"" says Stewart, as quoted by The Daily Mail. ""When this country awards medals to its soldiers, sailors, airmen and citizens they should be made in the UK.""

The decision is even resonating across the English Channel, inside Britain's traditional rival and erstwhile enemy. A story about the new contract on the France TV Info site starts with the sentence, ""Admiral Nelson must be turning in his grave."""
"216","UN to vote Wednesday on new North Korea sanctions.txt",422,979,43,"UNITED NATIONS (AP)  A U.N. Security Council vote on the toughest dsanctions on North Korea in two decades has been postponed until Wednesday morning at Russia's request, the United States and France said Tuesday.

The U.S. and North Korea's traditional ally China spent seven weeks negotiating the new sanctions  which include mandatory inspections of cargo leaving and entering North Korea by sea or air  in response to Pyongyang's latest nuclear test and rocket launch. Both are in defiance of previous council resolutions.

But Russia, which received the new draft Thursday along with other council members, asked for time to study the lengthy text, and suggested changes.

The United States late Monday asked the council to schedule a vote Tuesday afternoon. But the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said ""Russia invoked a procedural 24-hour review of the resolution, so the vote will be on Wednesday.""

Angola's U.N. Ambassador Ismael Gaspar Martins, the current council president, said hopefully the resolution will be adopted ""by consensus.""

The U.S., its Western allies and Japan pressed for new sanctions that went beyond the North's nuclear and missile programs but China, Pyongyang's neighbor, was reluctant to impose measures that could threaten the stability of North Korea and cause its economy to collapse.

The final draft, obtained by The Associated Press, would eliminate loopholes in previous sanctions resolutions and impose new ones. But it stresses that the new measures are not intended to have ""adverse humanitarian consequences"" for civilians, the majority who face economic hardships and food shortages.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday that the U.S. administration knows the North Korean people ""have suffered for far too long"" because of decisions from their government. ""And that's why this sanctions regime is targeted more specifically at the North Korean elite.""

For the first time, the draft resolution would require the 192 other U.N. member states to inspect all cargo from North Korea or heading to the country for illicit goods, ban any sale or transfer of small arms and light weapons to Pyongyang, and require all countries to expel diplomats from the North who engage in ""illicit activities.""

It would also for the first time impose significant sanctions on broad sections of the North Korean economy.

The draft resolution would ban the export of coal, iron and iron ore that is being used to fund North Korea's nuclear or ballistic missile programs  and it would prohibit all exports of gold, titanium ore, vanadium ore and rare earth minerals. It would also ban aviation fuel exports to the country, including ""kerosene-type rocket fuel.""

Earnest said North Korea uses revenue from sectors like coal, iron, gold, titanium and rare earth materials to bankroll its nuclear and missile programs, and ""the North Korean ruling elite"" also benefits from those sectors.

In the financial and banking sector, countries would be required to freeze the assets of companies and other entities linked to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Under a previous resolution, they were encouraged to do so.

The draft would also prohibit all countries from opening new branches, subsidiaries and representative offices of North Korean banks, and ban financial institutions from establishing new joint ventures or establishing or maintaining correspondent relationships with these banks. It would also order countries to close all North Korean banks and terminate all banking relationships within 90 days.

North Korea is already subject to four rounds of U.N. sanctions imposed since the country's first nuclear test in 2006.

Under those resolutions, it is banned from importing or exporting nuclear or missile items and technology as well as luxury goods.

The new draft would expand the list of banned items  adding luxury items such as expensive watches, snowmobiles, recreational water vehicles and lead crystal.

It would also add 16 individuals, 12 ""entities"" including the National Aerospace Development Agency which was responsible for February's rocket launch, and 31 ships owned by the North Korean shipping firm Ocean Maritime Management Company to the sanctions blacklist which requires the freezing of assets, and in the case of individuals a travel ban as well.

In addition to the mandatory inspection of cargo heading to or from North Korea by air or sea, the draft resolution would ban Pyongyang from chartering vessels or aircraft, and call on countries to ""de-register"" any vessel owned, operated or crewed by the North.

While focusing on new sanctions, the draft resolution also demands that North Korea immediately comply with the Security Council's previous bans on ballistic missile launches, nuclear tests ""or any other provocation."" It also reaffirms the council's decisions that the North abandon all nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and its ballistic missile program.

As with previous resolutions, the test will be whether U.N. member states enforce the sanctions. A U.N. panel of experts monitoring the sanctions has repeatedly pointed out that enforcement in a significant number of cases has been weak.

North Korea has ignored many demands, and tried to circumvent others.

It started off the new year with what it claims was its first hydrogen bomb test on Jan. 6 and followed up with the launch of a satellite on a rocket on Feb. 7. It was condemned by much of the world as a test of banned missile technology.

The draft resolution reiterates ""the importance of maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in northeast Asia at large, and expresses its commitment to a peaceful, diplomatic and political solution to the situation."" It calls for a resumption of six-party talks leading to the goal of ""the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful manner."" North Korea withdrew from the talks in 2008.

It also expresses the council's ""determination to take further significant measures"" in the event of another North Korean nuclear test or launch.

Syria's ""cessation of hostilities"" is making a difference - whatever the arguments about early violations, the level of violence across the country has fallen - and with this fragile modicum of progress, the United States and Russia find themselves in harness after years in which Syria was a forum for their rivalry.

""My worry is that it is the Russians making the weather,"" says Lieutenant General Sir Simon Mayall, senior Middle East adviser at the UK Ministry of Defence until last autumn.

""It was in their gift to offer a ceasefire on behalf of the Assad regime. That slightly worries me in a part of the world where the Americans have been the guarantors and the people who make the weather.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The United States has publically conceded that President Assad can remain in power ""for now"".

Following on from the Munich agreement of earlier this month, Russia and the US have become co-chairs of the International Syria Support Group working parties dealing with the implementation of humanitarian supplies, as well as the deal under which President Bashar al-Assad's forces and groups of the ""non-terrorist opposition"" are meant to stop shooting at each other.

President Bashar al-Assad

Born on 11 September 1965, second son of President Hafez al-Assad

Trained in ophthalmology in Syria and London

Brother Basil died in a car crash in 1994

Succeeded father in June 2000, aged 34

Married British-born Asma Akhras in December 2000

Won third term in office in June 2014, in an election dismissed as ""a farce"" by some, with 88.7% of votes cast in government-controlled areas

Both powers have worked hard to deliver this deal, and both now have a vested interest in its success.

""They are co-owners, insofar as the Russians respect the political process, and do apply pressure on Assad to stop bombing and take the process seriously,"" says Karin von Hippel, until recently a senior State Department official dealing with US strategy against the so-called Islamic State (IS) group, and now director general of the Royal United Services Institute think-tank.

Washington regards rapid progress towards political talks between the Assad government and the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), an umbrella group of his opponents, as essential.

Russian airpower

But privately officials are nervous, both about Russian attempts to brand any group that has ever co-operated with militant elements like IS or the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front as ""terrorist"" and, therefore, ineligible to take part in, or make any significant move towards moving President Assad off the political stage.

As the US has pressed ahead with its Russian partners, the whispering has started in London or Paris about how John Kerry, US Secretary of State, has allowed himself to align with a Russian plan to keep Mr Assad in power indefinitely.

The US has conceded publicly that the Syrian leader can stay ""for now"", and it's clear also that they have used considerable pressure to compel their allies to go along with the Munich agreement.

Image copyright AP Image caption Saudi jet fighters parked at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey

In the run up to Munich, both Syrian opposition and European sources were saying that Mr Kerry had threatened the HNC with a complete aid cut-off unless they went along with the peace process.

As Syrian government and allied forces, backed by Russian airpower, advanced north of Aleppo early in February, both Turkey and Saudi Arabia looked set to intervene in defence of rebel groups they have been supporting.

On 11 February, for example, Saudi MoD spokesman Brigadier Ahmed al-Assiri, said his country had taken a ""final"" and ""irreversible"" decision to send ground troops to Syria in order combat the so-called Islamic State. Turkish forces, meanwhile, were shelling Syrian Kurdish groups, and were accused by Russia of preparing to invade their southern neighbour.

Syrian partition?

This mid-February crisis, which could have put Russian forces supporting President Assad on a collision course with those of Nato-member Turkey or seen a ground push into eastern Syria by the Saudis passed, thanks to US pressure on its allies.

Speaking to journalists on Monday, Brigadier al-Assiri said: ""If there is any consensus around ground troops in Syria, we will be in the front line.""

Instead of sending ground troops, Saudi Arabia has, for the moment, contented itself with deploying a handful of jets to Turkey to carry out strikes on IS.

Media caption Lt Gen Sir Simon Mayall, on the diplomatic effects of defeating the so-called Islamic State.

The degree to which the fight against IS remains apart from, or linked to, the wider question of peace in Syria is one of the many factors complicating the present picture.

Some in Washington have argued that advancing on the militant group's de-facto capital, Raqqa, is a higher US national security interest than the removal of Mr Assad.

The Munich agreement, which effectively buys quiet with many of Syria's opposition groups, so that the US and Russia can focus their strike power on IS and the Nusra Front, fits neatly with such thinking.

""Assad has managed to make it a binary confrontation between the state and 'the terrorists',"" says Lt Gen Mayall.

So what happens if the political process stalls or President Assad's forces are found to be breaking the truce regularly?

Russia's UN envoy has suggested that pressure would be brought to bear on the Syrian leader. But speaking to senators in Washington last week, Mr Kerry referred to ""Plan B"" options. ""It may be too late to keep it as a whole Syria,"" he suggested, raising the spectre of partition.

Many in the Syrian opposition argue that the US really has no leverage over Assad and that his government could be quite happy with partition.

At a rally in Ohio on Tuesday, he criticised Mrs Clinton, saying she ""does not have the strength or the stamina to be president"".

The colourful campaign of the billionaire, who won three of the four early voting states, has divided Republicans.

On the eve of the polls, Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse became the highest-ranked elected party member to come out and say he would not back him for president.

He said he was ""frustrated and saddened"" and would look for a third option if Mr Trump won the Republican nomination.

As he voted in Texas, Mr Cruz turned his fire on Mr Trump: ""The only campaign that is in a position to beat Donald Trump on Super Tuesday is our campaign.

""And if you don't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, if you don't want us to give this election to Hillary Clinton, then I ask you to stand with us today.""

Marco Rubio, the third-placed Republican contender after Mr Trump and Mr Cruz, is hoping to stay competitive, gambling on a win in his home state of Florida on 15 March.

Mr Trump's commitment to several controversial immigration pledges, including the wholesale deportation of illegal immigrants and construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border, was called into question on Monday after reports describing an off-the-record conversation with the New York Times editorial board.

Mr Cruz, Mr Rubio and former Republican candidate Mitt Romney have called on Mr Trump to authorise the release of the transcript, in which Mr Trump reportedly says his hardline immigration policies would be flexible if he were elected.

Early exit poll results show the majority of Republican supporters in six states voting on Tuesday said they supported Mr Trump's call for a ban on non-Muslim citizens entering the country.

However, they were more divided on the deportation of illegal immigrants overall. Large numbers also expressed negative feelings towards federal government, AP reports.

Mr Trump has also faced heavy criticism over his failure to disavow David Duke, a leader of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan, who has endorsed the Republican candidate.

Protesters, including some from the Black Lives Matter movement, repeatedly disrupted a Trump rally in Radford, Virginia, on Monday after his refusal to condemn Mr Duke.

On Tuesday, Mr Trump said he had on several occasions in the past disavowed Mr Duke.

Democratic race

Democrats are voting in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Minnesota, as well as in the US territory of American Samoa.

Democrats abroad will also submit their votes. There is also a caucus in Colorado, but the vote then goes to a state convention.

After Donald Trump's resounding win in Nevada, the candidates are already shifting their focus to 1 March or Super Tuesday - a flood of primaries squeezed into a single day. Super Tuesday can be a day of reckoning for campaigns - exposing candidates who can't complete on the national stage and instantly catapulting others to the nomination.

Why so many races at once?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Millions of people will cast ballots for both Republican and Democratic candidates on Super Tuesday

Super Tuesday was developed in 1988 to combat the so-called ""Iowa syndrome."" Iowa, which votes first in the presidential race, has been criticised for not being representative of the American electorate. It's a small state and candidates often spend months campaigning there. Dedicated candidates with few resources - such as Rick Santorum in 2012 - have been known to excel there. So Super Tuesday is meant to introduce the candidates to the rigours (and the costs) of running a national campaign - creating a sink-or-swim moment for campaigns.

How many states are voting?

Will this Super Tuesday be the end of the road for anyone?

In the past, Super Tuesday has been known to be decisive. Mitt Romney essentially secured the Republican nomination after his Super Tuesday wins in 2012. This year, the result will not be as clear cut. Because many of the states on 1 March allot delegates proportionally, look for some candidates like Marco Rubio and John Kasich to wait until 15 March when large winner-take-all states such as Florida and Ohio vote. That said, the campaign of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has privately said it is likely to end his run on Super Tuesday. He has underperformed in the first four Republican contests and many insiders have wondered why he has not called it quits already.

On the Democratic side, Mr Sanders - once thought of as a protest candidate to advance the issue of income inequity - is likely to revert to that status and stay in the race even if Mrs Clinton wins big."
"221","US February auto sales hit best performance since 2000.txt",340,672,33,"New York (AFP) - Automakers scored strong US sales in February, pulling away from January's slowdown at the best pace since 2000.

Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Honda and Nissan had double-digit increases. Sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks again were hot sellers as cheap gasoline prices drove buyers to the fuel guzzlers.

Total sales climbed 6.9 percent from last February to 1.34 million vehicles, according to Autodata, in line with estimates. The pace of sales was an annual rate of 17.54 million, up seven percent from a year ago.

Ford, the number-two US automaker, scored a 20.4 percent year-over-year increase in February, with 217,192 vehicles sold, well above expectations.

Ford said its Ford brand sport-utility vehicle sales last month set a company record, totaling 65,016 SUVs, up 28 percent from a year ago. Overall SUV sales advanced 29.2 percent to 54,420 units.

F-series pickup truck sales were robust, too, rising 10 percent, the best performance in a decade.

""We saw a solid industry last month and a strong month for Ford, as customer demand for our newest vehicles -- including new high-end series on Explorer and Edge -- helped Ford increase its average transaction prices at almost double the industry average,"" said Mark LaNeve, Ford vice president of US marketing, sales and service.

FCA US, the US arm of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said US sales jumped 12 percent to 182,879 units, topping forecasts.

Jeep brand sales advanced 23 percent in February, with Jeep Cherokee, Wrangler, Patriot and Compass models racking up their best February ever.

Five other brands set records in the month, including the Ram pickup truck and van, and the Dodge Journey crossover.

GM, the largest US automaker, said sales fell 1.5 percent from a year ago to 227,825 units, dragged lower by a 39 percent drop in rental deliveries.

""The Toyota division had back-to-back, best-ever light truck monthly records, supported by another best-ever month in February for RAV4,"" one of the company's crossover SUVs, said Bill Fay, group vice president and general manager for the Japanese company's US division.

Honda scored a 12.8 percent rise year-on-year, at 188,985 Honda and Acura vehicles. Civic sales revved up 31.7 percent.

Nissan's US sales climbed 11 percent over the prior year to 130,911 units, a February record. Sales of Nissan crossovers, trucks and SUVs also set a February record, up 14 percent.

Volkswagen, mired in an emissions cheating scandal that has spurred multiple probes and lawsuits in the United States, said US sales tumbled 13.2 percent to 22,321 units, though luxury brand Audi had a modest gain.

After 2015's record-breaking sales, so far this year the US auto market seems to be setting up for another banner year, said Jeremy Acevedo of Edmunds.com.

i toggle caption Emily Harris/NPR Emily Harris/NPR

Two Israeli soldiers using a navigation app got lost and mistakenly entered a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank on Tuesday, leading to a series of confrontations in which a Palestinian man was killed and four others reportedly were wounded by gunfire.

Israel's military said 10 Israeli security forces were wounded during the clashes.

The two soldiers apparently lost their way while using the Israeli-developed app called Waze. They strayed into the Qalandia camp, a dense urban neighborhood that was originally set up as a refugee camp 50 years ago. The soldiers were attacked and their vehicle set on fire. The violence escalated when other Israeli forces were sent to rescue them.

Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told NPR's Emily Harris that the soldiers were on duty and driving to a destination in the West Bank when directions from Waze led them into the Qalandia camp. The area, Lerner said, is ""known for its heightened violence when military forces go in there.""

The Israeli soldiers were ""pelted with rocks and firebombs"" and fled their vehicle after it caught fire, The Associated Press reported, citing Israeli military spokesman Brig. Gen. Motti Almoz.

Lerner said a distress call from one soldier came in just before 11 p.m. local time, and that it took 20 minutes to find him. It took another 40 minutes to rescue the other soldier.

The AP reported that one soldier escaped ""to a nearby Jewish settlement and the other [took] cover in the yard of a Palestinian family for about an hour before he was rescued by the Israeli troops amid heavy clashes.""

The rescue mission was over by 4 a.m., Lerner told NPR.

The AP added that the ""Palestinian Red Crescent identified the killed Palestinian man as university student Eyad Sajadiyeh, saying he was shot in the head during the fighting. The Israeli military said 10 security personnel were wounded.""

Lerner confirmed that the soldiers who wandered into the camp were using Waze, noting that in Israel the app has a ""fail-safe"" mechanism to warn Israelis of Palestinian towns where Israel believes it is dangerous for its citizens to travel, such as Qalandia. He said, however, that the military's after-action review found that the fail-safe had been turned off.

When asked if it was the standard for soldiers to use Waze for navigation, Lerner said, ""We would expect the soldiers not to use it as a default,"" adding that the soldiers' usage of the app was under review.

A spokesperson for Waze, which was acquired by Google in 2013, confirmed that the safety mechanism had been disabled. In a statement to NPR, the company asserted that the app was not at fault:

""The Waze application includes a specific default setting that prevents routes through areas which are marked as dangerous or prohibited for Israelis to drive through. In this case, the setting was disabled. In addition, the driver deviated from the suggested route and as a result, entered the prohibited area. ""There were also red signs on the road in question that prohibit access to Palestinian controlled territories. It's the responsibility of every driver to adhere to road and traffic signs and obey local laws- in this incident there were multiple layers of prevention in place. ""Waze has and is continuing to work directly with the relevant authorities to decrease such mishaps from occurring, but unfortunately there is no ability to prevent them all together as ultimately some prudence is in the driver's hands.""

This isn't the first time Waze has come under scrutiny. As NPR reported last year, law enforcement officials urged the app to disable a feature that ""allows users to report when they've spotted a police officer, in real time, for all other Waze users to see."" Police said it endangers officers' lives."
"225","Utah shooting raises questions on when police release video.txt",387,709,32,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  Police are refusing to release body camera video of Salt Lake City officers shooting and critically injuring a 17-year-old Somali refugee, fueling public outcry and leading some to call the decision on when to reveal such footage inconsistent.

Footage from officers' body cameras is at the center of a national discussion about police use of force, especially with minority victims, and authorities around the country are working to decide when to reveal video from the increasingly popular law enforcement tool.

Twenty-three states have created laws for body cameras, many passed last year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Authorities have declined to release the footage from Saturday's shooting until they finish investigating. Keeping it private until investigators have sifted through the evidence to put the video in context is fairer to officers and the victim, said Unified Police Detective Ken Hansen, whose department is investigating.

Abdi Mohamed, who came to the U.S. with his family in 2004, was shot twice in the torso last weekend when officers tried to stop him and another person from beating a man with metal sticks, police said.

Officers told them to drop their weapons, but the teen moved menacingly toward the victim, authorities said. Mohamed remained in critical condition Tuesday.

View gallery Protester Nacom Koffi, left, shouts during rally for a 17-year-old boy who is in critical condition 

The shooting stirred unrest Saturday in the city's bustling downtown, where about 100 officers in riot gear barricaded four city blocks as bystanders threw rocks and bottles. Hundreds of people turned out for a protest Monday, some carrying signs saying, ""Stop killer cops.""

The incident shows the lack of consistent guidelines for police body camera footage, said Anna Brower, spokeswoman for the ACLU in Utah. A day after a deadly police shooting last year, the Salt Lake City department released video showing a man attacking the officer with a snow shovel.

""When police don't have a standard response for these kinds of situations, they put the public in a position of wondering, 'Why is it taking longer? What are you hiding?'"" Brower said.

Former Mayor Rocky Anderson said the different ways of handling the footage makes it look like police are opportunistic, releasing videos that make them look good and holding back others with problems.

Because Mohamed survived, he could face criminal charges or sue the department, factors that may bolster the argument for withholding the footage, said Connor Boyack, president of Libertas Institute, a Utah libertarian-leaning nonprofit.

View gallery Protesters take to the streets in Salt Lake City during rally and march for a 17-year-old boy who is 

But his group generally favors videos' quick release, saying it creates transparency and quiets the backlash against police.

Michael Millard, president of the union for city officers, said he would like to see all videos withheld until investigators and prosecutors have finished their work. It's more important that officers and suspects are treated fairly than it is to stem curiosity, he said.

It has become such a hot topic that Republican Gov. Gary Herbert weighed in, saying Tuesday that he thinks it's appropriate to keep the video private as the investigation unfolds.

Police have been tight-lipped on details surrounding the shooting, leaving questions about why Mohamed was in the part of town that police regularly patrol to crack down on drug dealing and violence.

Mohamed's cousin Muslima Waladi told the Deseret News that Mohamed was a good kid but started getting in trouble after falling in with a bad crowd.

He had a juvenile history of a dozen offenses since late 2010, including theft, trespassing and aggravated assault with a weapon, court records show.

Mohamed and his family fled war-torn Somalia and arrived in the U.S. by way of Kenya more than 10 years ago. There is a relatively large community of refugees in Salt Lake City, where a strong economy and Mormon outreach programs can make it easier to find jobs and settle into a new life, said Deb Coffey, executive director of the Utah Refugee Center.

Refugees have to navigate transportation, schools for their children and learning English, which for some is their first written language.

""It's joyful and exciting, and there's also fear. It's hard,"" Coffey said."

Jan Kearns, a special education teacher originally from Canada, recently became a U.S. citizen and was voting in her first presidential election. Experience was a key factor in her decision to support Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.

Kearns admires Clinton's stance on equal pay for women and says she knows how government works. She agreed with a lot of Sanders' positions but questioned whether he could succeed as president.

""He's a little too earthy, crunchy for the way Washington works,"" she said after voting in Framingham, Massachusetts.

Dormetra Henry, a 50-year-old clerical worker from Houston, said for her it was a toss-up between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump but that in the end, it was her faith that helped her decide to vote for Cruz.

""We're deeply religious and I believe Ted Cruz, he has a heart for the Lord. I believe that he is a Christian,"" said Henry, who is nondenominational but was previously Catholic.

Henry said while she had her doubts about Trump's Christian values, she still admires his strong personality.

""He says whatever he wants to say, and he doesn't really care about any repercussions,"" she said. ""That can be good and bad. You can't go into the presidential office and tell all these other countries, 'We don't care what you do,' and they bomb us. So you have to be careful.""

""She has been the one who has stepped out to at least try to identify with most of the minorities, whether they're women, black, Asian, Hispanic,"" Greta Lewis said. ""She's the one that has taken the most time to talk about it, to have something to say about it and be firm about it, and know who the leader of the KKK is.""

Twin sisters Vivien and Gillian Gattie, both retired, 72 years old and originally from England, were less than thrilled at their options as they showed up to cast ballots at Boston City Hall.

""I'm so appalled at the choices,"" said Gillian, an independent who voted for President Barack Obama twice, but chose a Republican, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, as a ""protest vote"" because she didn't care for any Republican or Democrat this time around.

She said she would only vote for Hillary Clinton in November if it came down to a contest between her and Donald Trump.

Vivien, a registered Democrat who also voted for Obama in the last two presidential elections, cast her ballot for Clinton, though reluctantly.

""I voted for her because I think she can win,"" she said. ""I can't get excited for Bernie Sanders.""

Like her sister, Vivien said she has concerns about Clinton.

""I really don't care for her much. I don't trust her,"" Vivien said. ""But I think she's qualified  the most qualified of the candidates.""

Gillian agreed, adding that Clinton's record as secretary of state and the controversy over her use of personal email for official business blemished her trustworthiness.

Retired Marine Corps. Gen. Bill Weise joined about a dozen people waiting patiently in line at the Greenspring precinct in Fairfax County, which traditionally has the highest turnout in Virginia. The precinct is made up entirely of voters from the sprawling Greenspring retirement community.

The 86-year-old Weise says seven months of agonizing over who he'd vote for came down to the final 10 seconds before he filled in the bubble next to Ted Cruz's name. Ben Carson was his favorite candidate, but he concluded Carson wasn't viable. In sorting through the other GOP candidates, Weise felt Cruz would make better decisions than Donald Trump.

""I've read Cruz's autobiography,"" he said. ""He's not perfect. But show me somebody who is. ...The ideal candidate does not exist.""

Michael Kernyat of Chesterfield County, Virginia, voted for John Kasich even though he thinks he probably just threw his vote away.

The 60-year-old retired computer consultant said Kasich is ""the most reasonable person running"" but probably has no chance of beating Donald Trump.

""Nobody is going to stop that freight train,"" Kernyat said. ""I think it's going to come down between him and Hillary (Clinton).""

He said people seem to be rallying behind Trump because ""they're tired of politics as usual,"" but he prefers the moderate positions of Kasich.

""The only one who really scares me in this election is Bernie (Sanders),"" Kernyat said.

Jim Stephens, a 72-year-old retired pastor from Anchorage, Alaska, supported Marco Rubio.

""I believe of the three main ones, he probably has the best chance of winning against the Democratic person that's running,"" said Stephens, who now works part-time in a hardware store. He and his second wife have five daughters and 13 grandchildren.

Stephens said John Kasich would be his second choice, but he doesn't believe the Ohio governor could win in the general election.

He also had thoughts on how Donald Trump is conducting himself, comparing him to a schoolyard bully.

""I just think that doesn't show the level of stature for a presidential person,"" Stephens said.

Jacob Lawrence-Simon, a software developer for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, started his day as a Bernie Sanders volunteer at 4:30 a.m., hanging notices on doors to remind voters to caucus.

Lawrence-Simon, 30, said he supports Sanders because of his views on gay rights, a higher minimum wage and his ""desire to not go to war.""

""I want politicians to try to solve an issue without bombs first ... and I feel like Bernie Sanders better represents that mentality than Hillary Clinton, who seems to be like a bomb-and-fix kind of candidate,"" Lawrence-Simon said.

___

Tyler Murphy, a 26-year-old Boston resident who works as a project manager for a construction company, voted for Donald Trump on Tuesday even though he thinks the billionaire businessman is ""undeniably wrong on a lot of things.""

For better or worse, he said, the controversial candidate is the ""wake-up call"" the country needs.

""Ultimately, if we have to elect someone who is borderline crazy to get people to understand what's going on, then that's what we have to do,"" Murphy said.

An independent, he voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and Barack Obama in 2008 and said he's donated to both parties in the past.

Murphy said that if Trump had not become such a viable candidate, he would likely have voted for Hillary Clinton.

""I just don't think she's going to be the person to shake people out of their seats,"" he said. ""She's not what the country needs right now.""

More than 38,000 Americans were killed in motor vehicle-related accidents and 4.4 million were critically injured. The agency estimated the costs of accidents in 2015 was $412.1 billion.

The NSC partly attributed the rise in accidents to higher traffic on roads caused by low gas prices and booming auto sales. The number of miles driven by Americans was up by about 3.5% in 2015, according to the Department of Transportation.

With the mass popularity of smartphones and other devices, distracted driving is also becoming a greater problem on the roads. In the past month, about 70% of drivers have driven while talking on their cellphone and nearly half read a text or email while behind the wheel, according to a AAA study released Feb. 25. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that at least 3,000 motor vehicle deaths each year involve distracted driving.

States are responsible for enforcing distracted driving laws. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia ban hand-held cellphone use while driving and 46 states and the District of Columbia ban texting while driving, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association. For new drivers, all cellphone use while driving is banned by 37 states and the District of Columbia.

"228","What difference will Obama's plan to bring power to Africa make_.txt",418,832,49,"Image copyright AFP

In February US President Barack Obama signed an agreement to bring electricity to 50 million people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020. Neil Ford asks, even if this is possible, how many will still be left in the dark?

Perhaps the most remarkable things about the Electrify Africa Act of 2015 are that it commits the US to increased foreign aid at a time of economic uncertainty and cuts through sharp political divisions.

The Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, worked with Democrat Eliot Engel for two years to drive the bill through Congress.

The act commits the US government to supporting President Obama's Power Africa initiative. Although headlined as a $50bn (36bn) scheme, the US authorities will contribute just $7bn.

Other governments, development agencies and private sector companies are expected to provide the remainder in public-private partnerships.

This will be difficult to achieve during a global economic downturn.

Even if it succeeds in its aim of bringing electricity to 50 million Africans by 2020, more than 10 times that number will still be without power.

So the Power Africa initiative is not a magic bullet, but it has at least highlighted Africa's power supply problems.

Permanently off grid

It is easy to take electricity for granted.

Most African homes lack fridges and electric cookers but even a single electric light bulb can bring security and allow children to do their homework after dark.

Mobile phones encourage economic growth but the lack of electricity makes recharging them yet another hurdle to be cleared.

According to the latest World Bank data, 35% of sub-Saharan Africans have no access to electricity.

This is a far lower figure than in any other region.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People who do not have electricity use charcoal to cook

The next lowest rate is 22% for South Asia, while all five North African countries claim 100% coverage.

Most Africans use wood and kerosene for fuel, causing deforestation and thousands of fatal accidents every year.

The 35% figure masks huge variations, with electrification rates ranging from 5% in South Sudan up to 100% in Mauritius.

Connection rates in rural areas are typically worse than 10%.

Most of those with electricity at home live in cities, supplied by grids that were developed in colonial times but which have failed to expand with urban growth.

Even many of those connected to the grid suffer from unreliable supplies.

So those who can afford them, buy their own expensive diesel fired generators.

While South Africa relies on coal-fired plants, most African countries depend on large hydro schemes to generate electricity.

Yet unreliable rainfall means that hydroelectric production varies even during a good year and is even worse - as at present - during an El Nino event.

The main problem is a lack of revenue.

Most consumers are unable to afford to pay a commercial rate for electricity.

This prevents power utilities from earning enough money to pay for new generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure; generation capacity to produce electricity; transmission to move it across big distances; and distribution to get it into people's homes and businesses.

Either people need to become richer, or power needs to be cheaper.

Luckily, a solution may be at hand.

The price of photovoltaic (PV) solar power panels is falling, while solar cells are becoming more efficient, so PV is becoming a cost-effective option.

Such off-grid solutions avoid the need for expensive transmission and distribution infrastructure.

Juice for mobiles

Power Africa is already supporting very small-scale solar PV.

It has awarded part-funding to 28 off-grid projects, along with the technical support that small-scale developers often lack.

Many more will now follow suit.

Image copyright Clare Spencer Image caption The first kWh is said to be the most valuable because it powers your mobile phone

Most of these projects involve solar PV or biomass, which involves using agricultural waste as a power generation feedstock.

Power Africa describes the first kWh people gain access to as the ""the most valuable"" because it provides at least a single source of electric light and the ability to charge mobile phones and radios.

With its commitment to providing ""cleaner power generation"", many of the on-grid ventures backed by Power Africa also involve renewable energy.

In some cases, it is directly funding generation projects, such as the 152 MW Sarreole wind farm in Senegal.

More often, it will supply technical support and dedicated advisors.

It has already helped Ghana to tap its newly discovered gas reserves for thermal power production by providing regulatory advice.

New projects will be identified as more of the funding is made available.

It may be that a single grand scheme cannot solve Africa's power problems but Power Africa can help provide local solutions, one at a time."

"230","When Samuel Beckett Tried to Capture the Power of the Movies.txt",782,1650,74,"In the summer of 1964, Samuel Beckett arrived in New York City for his first and only trip to the United States, to oversee production on what would be his first and only film. Titled Film, it was commissioned by the avant-garde publisher Barney Rosset as part of a triptych; the other two pieces were written by Harold Pinter and Eugne Ionesco (both of whom, like Beckett, were published by Rossets Grove Press), though Rosset was unable to bring those to fruition. Beckett, by the mid-nineteen-sixties, had cemented his global reputation with the successes of Waiting for Godot and Endgame, and he and Rosset marshalled a remarkable collection of talent for their movie: celebrated theater director Alan Schneider; cinematographer Boris Kaufman, who had worked on 12 Angry Men and On the Waterfront, among other films; and, most notably, the silent-screen legend Buster Keaton.

The plot of Film is, not surprisingly, scarce. O (Keaton) a dilapidated figure who wears an oversized trench coat and a flattened white Stetson, is pursued by E (the camera, essentiallyand, by proxy, you, the viewer). O scurries along Pearl Street, in the bombed-out area beneath the Manhattan end of the Brooklyn Bridge. He collides with an old couple who are dressed in quaint Victorian style, and whose perturbed stares slowly twist into horror. When E then confronts them, they shrink in the agony of perceivedness, according to the script. A similar encounter in the stairwell of an apartment building follows, this time with an old woman carrying flowers. Becketts spare text dictates that E can only approach O from behind and at an angle not exceeding 45 degrees. This angle of immunity is the hallmark of Becketts experiment: once it has been breached, then our hero, our O, will know he is perceived; horror will set in, and all will be lost.

Its really quite a simple thing . . . Its a movie about the perceiving eye, about the perceived and the perceivertwo aspects of the same man, Schneider explained to a writer for The New Yorker who visited the set. The perceiver desires like mad to perceive, and the perceived tries desperately to hide. Then, in the end, one wins. Simple enough.

Notfilm, a documentary by film historian Ross Lipman that traces the production of Film, recently had its North American premiere at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, as part of an annual festival put on by Film Comment. (After additional festival screenings this month, it will have a limited theatrical release in April.) Lipman draws on previously unheard conversations between Beckett, Schneider, and Kaufman, plus interviews with Rosset and the frequent Beckett collaborator Billie Whitelaw, among othersincluding the critic Leonard Maltin, who visited the set of Film as a teenager. Notfilm also features part of a never-before-seen prologue to Film, footage that had been stashed underneath Rossets kitchen sink for decades, and was thought lost.

Notfilm leaves you with the unmistakable sense of Film as a failed, fascinating experiment, a grand harnessing of craft and creative genius that couldnt gel into coherence. Yet, for all of its shortcomingsfailures that Beckett himself eventually acknowledgedLipman finds in Film genuine insights about Becketts work as a whole, and even about the nature of the movies. For Beckett, the cinema was pregnant with exciting, terrifying potential: the power to burn onto celluloid a performers likeness, his fears, his history, and make him confront, in a particularly modern way, his mortality.

The ideas about perception that Beckett explores in Film are both grandly philosophical and deeply personal. Lipman describes the movie as a tongue-in-cheek but pointed debate between Beckett and the Irish enlightenment philosopher George Berkeleyspecifically, Berkeleys notion that esse est percipi (To be is to be perceived).* But Lipman also notes that the very phenomenon of being recorded both repulsed and resonated deeply with Beckett, who was famously averse to having his voice captured on tape. He felt the cameras eye as a literal wound, Lipman argues. Cinema was, for Beckett, something like the fullest form of perception, with all the invasiveness and pain that that entailed.

For the character of O, Beckett at first wanted Zero Mostel or the Irish actor Jackie MacGowran, who had played Lucky in Waiting for Godot. But he had long been a fan of Keaton, tooin fact, Keaton was offered the role of Lucky in the original American run of Waiting for Godot, in 1956. (Keaton turned it down.) The bumbling physical comedy of Godot owes a great deal to vaudeville, and Keaton came from a vaudeville background: he started performing with his parents, as part of The Three Keatons, when he was three. In the early sixties, Keaton was still working, but his heyday was long since overand that past-his-prime quality resonates deeply in Film. O, as embodied by Keaton, is a man desperate to escape the camera and the penetrating eye of the public.

Becketts use of Keaton is knowingly perverse: since the script requires the camera to stay behind O until the end of the film, it deprives the viewer almost entirely of Keatons famous face. On set, Becketts regimen was punishing: he and Schneider insisted on take after take in hundred-degree weather. As Lipman notes, such demands were typical of Beckett, who often put his performers in gruelling situations: confining the actors in Play in urns, forcing the hobbled heroes of Endgame into uncomfortable physical contortions, or reducing the actress of Not I to a shrieking mouth. In that 1972 play, the star, Billie Whitelaw, had to be totally immobilized in black . . . everything black and tight, preventing her from moving any muscle at all, save for her mouth. It was an exercise in sensorial reduction, to reveal the pain of life itself.

According to Schneider, though, Keaton was a regular gentleman on set, indefatigable if not exactly loquacious. And his bumbling physicality made him the ideal choice for Film. In the movies climax, set in a sparsely furnished room that belongs to Os mother, O wages his final bid against perceptionfacing off, so to speak, with a parrot, a goldfish, a dog, a cat, and a rocking chair with a headrest cut into a shape that resembles a pair of eyes. In the scenes closing moments, O tears apart a print that depicts the Sumerian god Abu, and a series of pictures that stand in for the stages of life. Thinking his work done and perception vanquished, he rests. O, or maybe Keaton, can finally unburden himself of his profoundly heavy cinematic baggage, escape our perception, and drift into memory.

Or so it seems for a moment. Es gaze pierces the sleep . . . O half starts from chair, then stiffens, the script reads. Keaton, wearing an eye patch, finally faces the camera, looking startled and wary. He grips the chairs armrests. It is Os face . . . but with [a] very different expression, impossible to describe, neither severity nor benignity, but rather acute intentness, the script instructs. O falls back into his chair. He sits, bowed forward, his head in his hands, gently rocking. The end.

The shoot lasted for three weeks, with Schneider, as he recalled in an essay about directing Film, following Keatons every shambling gait, shooting more 180-degree and 360-degree pans than in a dozen Westerns. The veteran Keaton found the filmmaking practices of Schneider and Beckett, both cinematic novices, curious, and the production of Film suffered from amateurish scheduling and casting mix-ups. (An entire opening sequence, featuring pedestrians strolling under the Brooklyn Bridge, apparently drowning in self-perception, was ultimately rendered unusable, thanks to camera problems.) Beckett, Schneider, and Kaufman, meanwhile, could never quite settle on the proper visual signatures to distinguish O and Es perspectives. The idea of the movie was obscured by technical incompetence.

Film is the sort of thing that, when, youve done your experiment with the audience and you tell them [what its about], theyll all go, Ahhh,  the scholar Kevin Brownlow tells Lipman in Notfilm. But without that kind of critical direction, its meanings can be difficult to discern. Beckett, in a letter to Schneider, wrote that there had been a failure to communicate by purely visual means the works basic intention. But he thought that Film was a success in other ways. What came about from Film is that Samuel Beckett realized that he still loved cinema, but that motion-picture film wasnt his medium, Lipman told me. Beckett would turn to television, writing Eh Joe, in 1966, and, a decade later, Ghost Trio and . . . but the clouds . . . The first of these, Lipman pointed out, seems to pick up right where Film ends, with a long, slow zoom into a face. And all of the TV productions reprise the themes of Filmthe threat of perception, diminished physical spaces, spiritually collapsed menwhile adding something that Beckett willfully deprived himself of when making Film: spoken words, specifically the spare, haunting kind, married to precise stage directions, of the sort that he had mastered in his plays. Film was only the beginning of an effort both to investigate and to portray the power of the camera.

Film premiered on September 4, 1965, the third-to-last night of that years Venice Film Festival. Rex Reed, in the New York Times, described the scene: several hundred bikini-clad starlets surrounding the likes of Luchino Visconti, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Jean-Luc Godard, and then Keaton, looking for all the world like the kind of man dogs kick, with his pants a little baggy and his hat a bit crushed. Keaton said it was the first time hed ever been invited to a film festival. Critics mostly panned the moviebut then Keaton hadnt given them much to go on. Heck, Id be the last one in the world to comment, he told Reed, because I didnt know what those guys were doing half the time.

"231","Why did Pakistan keep hard-line mourners off air_.txt",442,846,39,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Supporters of Mumtaz Qadri protested at his execution but the protests were quieter than expected

When news of Mumtaz Qadri's execution hit the television screens on Monday morning, the Pakistani nation recoiled into long-familiar defensive mode.

Parents kept many children home from school, and some people stayed away from work. Across the country, Pakistanis were glued to their television sets in anticipation of riots on the streets by those who revered the former bodyguard who killed Punjab governor Salman Taseer for advocating blasphemy law reform.

But what protests there were were sporadic and not well attended. And though they burned tyres and beat up a couple of journalists, the protesters showed no inclination to target the security forces.

The mood of the crowds at Tuesday's funeral for Pakistan's most notorious death row prisoner was equally restrained. More importantly, news anchors of dozens of Pakistani television channels, who would normally be hysterical at such a development, seemed not to notice.

Instead, crime in Karachi and hints of a possible cancellation of an upcoming India-Pakistan cricket match dominated the headlines. So why the media silence when there was a golden chance to boost ratings?

""Obviously, they have been sent a piece of advice by an authority they can't ignore, and that authority is definitely not the political government,"" says Ayesha Siddiqa, a defence and political analyst.

Who is pulling the strings?

For most in Pakistan, the only authority that has been able to chastise a once-unbridled Pakistani media has been the military.

In an unprecedented move in April 2014, it was able to force one of the largest TV news channels, Geo, off air after it accused the ISI intelligence service of orchestrating an attack on one of its top journalists. The ban was ""fronted"" by the civilian-led media regulatory authority, Pemra, but observers saw the military pulling the strings behind the scenes.

On Monday, the day Mumtaz Qadri was hanged, Pemra held a meeting in which it threatened with closure TV channels that covered ""events that glorified criminals"". The message for Qadri's supporters was clear.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mumtaz Qadri (right) was arrested in 2011 and charged with the murder of Punjab governor Salman Taseer

But Pakistan's hard-line Islamists were not always like this.

In 2012, a conglomeration of religious forces styling itself as the Pakistan Defence Council (PDC) took the country by storm, holding big rallies in every corner of the country to sell a virulent anti-American and anti-Indian agenda.

In the words of Dawn newspaper's Cyril Almeida, the campaigners included ""jihadists, sectarian warriors, orthodox mullahs, Islamic revivalists, all banding together to defend Pakistan"".

The PDC showed no restraint at its rallies and Pemra did nothing to enforce its so-called responsible journalism guidelines.

The military establishment was widely seen by analysts as having played a role in the PDC, for two reasons: to deflect American pressure for action against the Taliban, and to frustrate the then government's plans to extend preferential trading status to India.

Is the military apolitical?

In 2014, thousands of activists loyal to former cricketer Imran Khan and a firebrand cleric Tahirul Qadri occupied Islamabad's high-security Red Zone for months, paralysing the government.

On one occasion they broke into the offices of Pakistan Television and put its various channels off air for several minutes. The military refused to intervene, claiming it was an ""apolitical"" institution which supported democracy.

The protests were seen by many as having had a nod from elements in the security establishment, again for two reasons - forcing the newly inducted government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to back down from a treason case it lodged against former army chief Pervez Musharraf, and to frustrate its aspirations to normalise relations with India, which had been one of Mr Sharif's main election slogans.

How Punjab governor's killer became a hero

What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws?

Salman Taseer: Death of a liberal

So what has changed now?

Analysts point out that with Nato's planned drawdown in Afghanistan, the Pakistani military is reordering its security policy to ensure its continued influence in Afghanistan and to prevent what many pro-establishment analysts describe as ""Indian hegemony"".

On the heels of this development has come the proposed $46bn economic corridor the Chinese are planning to build through Pakistan. This investment is seen by many as more than making up for the drying pipeline of American aid for a military that has been holding its own within a chronically cash-strapped economy.

In order to fully benefit from this investment, forces that can cause internal chaos must be quietened.

Many say this is what has been on display in Rawalpindi this week. Apart from paving the way for Chinese investment, this also sends out a message to the international community that Pakistan has the wherewithal to control militancy when it wants, says Ayesha Siddiqa.

But since there are still no signs a similar call has also been given to groups focused on India and Afghanistan, Pakistan is likely to continue to dabble in the tricky business of separating ""good"" militants from ""bad""."
"232","Why This German City Has Banned Coffee Pods In Government Buildings.txt",354,674,30,"Why This German City Has Banned Coffee Pods In Government Buildings

i toggle caption sg_harrison/Flickr sg_harrison/Flickr

While a caffeinated workforce is generally a happy one, it may not be an efficient one  at least, not from a planetary point of view, according to the German city of Hamburg. As part of a wider effort to reduce waste and energy consumption, Hamburg has banned the use of coffee pods in government-run buildings, offices and institutions like schools and universities.

Love them or hate them, single-use coffee capsules are a quick way to brew a reasonable cup of coffee, and Germans use roughly 3 billion pods a year. But Hamburg's Department for the Environment and Energy argues that coffee pods cause ""unnecessary resource consumption and waste generation,"" and ""often contain polluting aluminum.""

Coffee pods are just one of a variety of products city employees are no longer allowed to use on office premises. Mandatory green guidelines now prohibit taxpayers' money from being spent on nonrefillable plastic bottles, plastic cutlery, plates and cups, chlorine-based cleaning products, air freshener and patio heaters.

Hamburg is believed to be the world's first city to ban coffee pods. Jan Kerstan, Hamburg's environment senator, who announced the move to promote sustainable procurement, says the city wants to encourage businesses and private individuals to accept greater accountability for their purchasing decisions. ""Our objective is to increase the share of environmentally friendly products significantly, in order to help combat climate change,"" Kerstan argues.

And single-use coffee pods have been in the cross hairs of environmentalists. Some, like Keurig's K-Cups, are not recyclable (Keurig aims for 100 percent recyclability by 2020). Others are recyclable, but that doesn't ensure that those convenient little pods actually end up sorted with the plastic and glass  not tossed in the trash bin  after you've prepared your morning cup of Joe.

Nespresso, Europe's most popular pod provider  whose spokesman is the equally popular George Clooney  says it has 14,000 capsule collection points worldwide, with the capacity, at least, to recycle over 80 percent of all used capsules. The company aims to raise this to 100 percent by 2020.

In Germany, where municipal recycling amenities are widespread and long-established, Nespresso stresses that its almost entirely aluminum pods can be placed into the ubiquitous yellow bins in the backyard.

Nespresso told us that many of its pods end up at aluminum plants for reuse, together with the rest of Germany's domestic aluminum waste, such as food and drink cans. But the company wasn't able to confirm what percentage of used pods were actually recycled, either in Germany or elsewhere.

Jan Dube, spokesman for the Hamburg Department of the Environment and Energy, told us that, to his knowledge, ""most of the capsules can't be recycled easily, because they are often made of a mixture of plastic and aluminum,"" Dube says.

Nespresso says it was surprised by Hamburg's decision. The company insists that ""portioned coffee makes sense, both economically and in terms of sustainability."" Nespresso argues that reducing the amount of coffee and water used per cup has a bigger impact on carbon footprint than packaging  especially packaging made from aluminum.

Mindful of growing consumer awareness of pod waste, the Italian coffee brand Lavazza has developed a ""compostable capsule"": It's made from biodegradable organic materials that the company aims to turn into agricultural fertilizer. Whether that's enough to lure connoisseurs of Italian coffee made in traditional espresso machines remains to be seen.

In Hamburg, at least, the authorities have already made up their minds. Jan Dube says they simply cannot justify buying ""6 grams of coffee wrapped in 3 grams of packaging"" with taxpayer money. The city aims to cut down on packaging waste in general  whether it can be recycled or not.

Dube says that city authorities throughout Germany have been in touch to inquire about implementing similar bans. If the ad campaign ""Kill the K-Cup"" is accurate, and enough K-Cups were discarded in 2014 to circle Earth more than 10 times, then that route might bypass Germany in the future."
"233","Wine is all the rage with the Dodgers, as owners, investors and enthusiasts jump on grape bandwagon.txt",270,442,34,"A bottle of red, a bottle of white

Whatever kind of mood youre in tonight 

Like life doesnt offer enough reasons why you feel left behind, now comes this. Wine is all the rage among baseball types, perhaps most with the Boys in Blue.

Players, managers, former owners, advisors and now the organization itself, are all happily re-discovering the wonders of the ancient juice.

No doubt the expertise varies. Currently popular in the Dodgers spring clubhouse is a wine touted by Sandy Koufax, because you know, it was touted by Sandy Koufax. His find: Meiomi Pinot Noir 2013, which is currently available at your local Total Wine & More store for $16.99 a bottle. See, they are like you and me.

I tried it and gave it a very positive review, but being a few tastings shy of Robert Parker Jr., I consulted with The Times resident wine expert, ex-Dodgers beat writer Dylan Hernandez, who found it something less than 100 points and termed it over-oaked.

Like sucking on a tree, Hernandez said.

I have not run this review past Manager Dave Roberts, who is one of three owners of the Red Stitch winery in Napa. His Pinot Noir goes for $56 a bottle, though his sold-out signature Cabernet Sauvignon went for $90 a pop.

See more of our top stories on Facebook >>

Roberts, of course, is not the first Dodgers manager to go the vintner route. Tommy Lasorda still has his name across a series of wines imported from Italy, all priced under $30. That little ol' winemaker, Tommy.

Adrian Gonzalez is an investor in a wine bar near San Diego's Petco Park. Right-hander Joe Blanton, when he thought he was retiring in 2014, actually bought a vineyard in Napa. Must be neighbors with ex-Dodgers owner Jamie McCourt, who bought one there the year before.

Feeling left out yet?

Hey, at least now you can own your very own bottle of Dodgers wine. Thats right, a bottle of blue.

Starting March 1, Santa Marias Qupe winery is offering a Dodgers Syrah and Chardonnay. It comes complete with a blue label and the cursive Dodgers logo splashed across the Qupe poppy emblem. This comes from a real, legitimate winery.

The wines will be available this season at Dodger Stadium, and at Vons and Gelsons. Both are sold on the company website for $24. Will update with the Hernandez review as soon as its available.

The surge in bullishness boosted oil and other commodities, while the save-haven yen sagged and gold prices slipped.

In New York buyers plunged into bank and tech stocks, helping the broad S&P 500 index put on 2.4 percent, a level last seen on January 6.

Underpinning that were better-than-expected reports on the sluggish manufacturing sector, construction spending and auto sales that showed the US economy still resilient amid the global slowdown.

Earlier, Frankfurt's DAX 30 kicked off the new month with a 2.3 percent upswing as investors eyed possible fresh support from the European Central Bank (ECB) next week and official data showed German unemployment remained at historic lows in February.

Its Paris and London counterparts lagged but still finished the session higher.

The rally started in Asia helped by the People's Bank of China's cut to its reserve requirement for banks, a measure aimed at encouraging investment and spending to keep the economy from slowing too much.

It helped to offset more weak Chinese manufacturing figures. Official data Tuesday showed that February activity shrank at its fastest rate in four years.

The Chinese central bank's announcement boosted the mood across Asian trading floors, with Shanghai jumping 1.7 percent and Tokyo reversing early losses to close up 0.4 percent Tuesday.

India's main stocks index, meanwhile, posted a 3.4 percent gain, its biggest rise since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power almost two years ago, after the government presented a budget expected to boost rural demand.

- Investors bet on stimulus -

""The major indices across Asia managed to post some fairly solid gains, helping Europe to lift its positive start to the week and push the major European stock markets towards monthly highs,"" said James Hughes, chief market analyst at traders GKFX.

Also helping were Russian comments that a production freeze by major crude producers is still in the works. That helped crude prices higher, with Brent adding 0.7 percent at $36.81 a barrel and WTI, the US benchmark, gaining 1.9 percent at $34.40.

""Oil and the policy stimulus trade are probably the biggest driver of things at the moment,"" said Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com.

Even so, the strength of the buying surprised analysts, amid increasingly glum forecasts, in the US at least, for corporate earnings this year. S&P Capital IQ said it expects corporate earnings in the first quarter will fall by 6.1 percent; earlier a slight increase had been predicted.

In a statement Tuesday, Chapman said: ""I want to be clear, I did not in any way harm my girlfriend that evening. However, I should have exercised better judgment with respect to certain actions, and for that I am sorry.

""The decision to accept a suspension, as opposed to appealing one, was made after careful consideration. I made this decision in an effort to minimize the distractions that an appeal would cause the Yankees, my new teammates and most importantly, my family.""

After investigating the incident, authorities declined to file charges, citing conflicting and insufficient evidence, according to reports. Under baseballs domestic violence policy, introduced in August, the commissioner can levy discipline even if a player is not charged with a crime. Manfred said he had considered public documents, a staff report and an interview with Chapman.

""I found Mr. Chapmans acknowledged conduct on that day to be inappropriate under the negotiated policy, particularly his use of a firearm and the impact of that behavior on his partner,"" Manfred said.

The Dodgers had agreed to trade for the All-Star pitcher  envisioning a dynamic duo of Chapman and Kenley Jansen closing out games  before reports of the incident surfaced. They backed away, and the New York Yankees subsequently acquired Chapman from the Cincinnati Reds.

The announcement caps one of the sports three domestic violence investigations.

Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig is under investigation after a report that he hit his sister during a bar fight. No charges were filed.

Colorado Rockies infielder Jose Reyes was put on paid leave by the league, pending the conclusion of his criminal case on charges of abuse against his wife. Reyes' trial is set for April 4, in the absence of a resolution before then.

HAMILTON, Ohio (AP)  A 14-year-old boy accused of shooting students in a school cafeteria denied charges including attempted murder on Tuesday, while the sheriff in the southwest Ohio county urged that he be prosecuted as an adult and that all schools step up security.

The school district said classes will resume Wednesday, with extra staff on hand throughout the schools and particularly in the cafeteria where the shooting took place Monday. Madison Local Schools Superintendent Curtis Philpot said crisis counselors were available and that schools would be open Tuesday evening for families to walk through and ask questions so students will feel ""safe and comfortable"" back in class. School was canceled Tuesday for about 1,500 students.

The boy is charged in Butler County with attempted murder, felonious assault, inducing panic and making terroristic threats. Sitting at the defense table with his ankles shackled, he was silent and kept his head down as a prosecutor read the complaint against him, alleging he took a loaded handgun into school, fired ""several shots, hitting two students,"" causing a lockdown and bringing ""a huge law enforcement presence.""

Defense attorney Ed Perry entered a denial of the charges, the juvenile court equivalent of a not guilty plea, and a magistrate ordered that the suspect remain in juvenile detention pending a hearing April 5.

Perry and the boy's supporters declined to comment afterward. One apparent relative told reporters ""you have no idea"" about what the family is going through, but wouldn't say anything else or give a name.

The Associated Press doesn't generally name juveniles charged with crimes.

Sheriff Richard Jones said authorities have interviewed the youth and believe they know a motive, but they won't reveal it while their investigation is continuing. He said the youth apparently had a .380-caliber handgun obtained from a family member for ""some time,"" including all morning inside the school before he allegedly jumped up from a cafeteria table and opened fire.

Two students were shot and two others hurt, possibly by shrapnel or while running away, authorities said. All were expected to recover.

In a recorded call, a 911 caller who sounded like a young person reporting the shooting immediately identified the suspect by name. Breathing heavily, the unidentified caller told a dispatcher: ""He just pulled out his gun and started shooting.""

Jones said he is recommending to the prosecutor that he seek to have the case moved to adult court because of the serious nature of the charges.

""That may sound harsh, but you have to send a message to the kids,"" Jones told The Associated Press, saying students need to realize that using guns isn't like playing video games. He also said many young people and some staffers have likely been traumatized by the chaotic scene.

The Butler County prosecutor's office indicated it will explore options for handling the case, but hasn't made any decision. Authorities have said they don't believe the youth had a criminal record, which would be a factor for a judge deciding whether to keep him in the juvenile system to focus on rehabilitation.

Students were eating in the cafeteria when the shooting happened around 11:30 a.m. Monday, Jones said. The youth threw down his gun as he ran from the school and was soon arrested near the school with the help of a Middletown police K-9 unit, he said.

A sheriff's deputy stationed in the school had just been in the cafeteria, said Jones, who said the shooting underscores the need for every school to have such a police presence and to allow specially trained staff members to be armed, too.

""It could have been much worse,"" Jones said, adding it that while it was the first school shooting in memory in his county, there have been many lockdowns in recent months after threats were received.

The students who were shot were 14 and 15 years old and were taken to a hospital where they were in stable condition, investigators said.

A powerful former ally of Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has launched a party to challenge his 35-year rule.

Joice Mujuru said the Zimbabwe People First (ZPF) party had been formed because ""Zimbabwe is a broken country"".

Ms Mujuru was Mr Mugabe's second-in-command until he sacked her in 2014 after accusing her of plotting to oust and kill him.

""I'm neither a witch nor an assassin,"" Ms Mujuru said, at the party's launch in the capital, Harare.

She is the most senior former Zanu-PF leader to form an opposition party, and is tipped to be its presidential candidate in the 2018 election.

Her supporters ululated as she entered the hall to announce ZPF's launch, reports the BBC's Nomsa Maseko from the scene.

Joice Mujuru - key facts:

Image copyright AFP Image caption Ms Mujuru was once seen as Mr Mugabe's heir apparent in Zanu-PF

Was married to Solomon Mujuru, who was seen as Zanu-PF kingmaker

He died in suspicious fire in 2011

She was known as ""Spill Blood"" during the independence war

She claims to have shot down a Rhodesian helicopter with the machine-gun of a dying comrade and was later promoted to commander

After spending her youth fighting the war, she obtained secondary school qualifications and a degree while in government

Ms Mujuru, 60, was flanked by other former Zanu-PF heavyweights, including Didymus Mutasa and Rugare Gumbo.

She hailed the formation of ZPF as historic, and said it would fight the ""scourge of corruption"" in Zimbabwe.

""Some revolutionaries are busy pulling Zimbabwe down,"" Ms Mujuru said.

Our correspondent says she was a Zanu-PF member for more than 30 years, and will it find difficult to convince voters that she represents a new era.

But, encouragingly for Ms Mujuru, her supporters turned up at the launch to give their backing, she adds.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Mugabe celebrated his 92nd birthday at the weekend

Zanu-PF has nominated Mr Mugabe, who turned 92 last month, for re-election in 2018.

However, because of his advancing age, a battle to succeed him is raging in Zanu-PF between Mr Mugabe's wife, Grace, and Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was appointed to the post following Ms Mujuru's expulsion, correspondents say.

Mrs Mugabe led the campaign to oust Ms Mujuru, who was seen to harbour ambitions to succeed Mr Mugabe as Zanu-PF leader and president.

Analysis: Lewis Machipisa, BBC Africa

Ms Mujuru will take some support from Zanu-PF, but is unlikely to come remotely close to dislodging it from power.

Zanu-PF is a formidable force, with control over all state institutions.

It will not be surprising if law-enforcement agencies now investigate her over the business empire she and her late husband built following Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. They will want to know if she was involved in corruption or if her wealth is clean.

Her decision to form the ZPF party will not give the main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, sleepless nights. His Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) supporters see her as Mr Mugabe's jilted lover, and are unlikely to join her party.

She will struggle to establish a well-oiled party machinery, and is unlikely to receive financial support from Western donors because of her long relationship with Zanu-PF."
