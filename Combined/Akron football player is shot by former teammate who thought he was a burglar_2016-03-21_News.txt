Akron wide receiver Andrew Pratt is expected to recover after being accidentally shot in the stomach by a former teammate over the weekend.

Pratt entered the apartment of Scott Boyett, a former offensive tackle for the Zips, without knocking early Saturday morning. Both men told police Boyett fired the gun mistakenly thinking Pratt was a burglar.

After investigating the incident, police determined it was an accident and decided not to file charges.

Boyett was an offensive tackle for the Zips before dropping from the roster last spring because of an unspecified medical condition. He is still a student at Akron and has an apartment in the same off-campus house as Pratt.

The shooting occurred around 3 a.m. The police were called but Pratt had already been taken to the emergency room by the time they arrived.
