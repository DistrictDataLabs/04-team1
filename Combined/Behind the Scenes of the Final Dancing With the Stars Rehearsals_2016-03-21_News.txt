Just hours remain until the premiere of season 22 of "Dancing With the Stars."

"Good Morning America" went behind the scenes of the stars' final rehearsals before they tango and foxtrot their way into the ballroom.

"I'm not really nervous," said "Real Housewives of Atlanta" star Kim Fields, who is partnered with pro dancer Sasha Farber. "Sasha has 'Sasha-fied' me. [I'm] having the whole 'Sasha-facation.'"

"GMA" meteorologist Ginger Zee said she is up to the "huge challenge" of competing on "DWTS" while also doing her day job on "GMA" and being a new mom to her newborn son, Adrian.

"I love adventure," Zee said. "It's like any other new mom going back to work ... you wanna find yourself again."

"And I'm lucky," she added. "I've got support. I've got family friends, everybody that's making this not as difficult as it could be."

One star, Marla Maples, has already won the endorsement of a presidential candidate, her former husband Donald Trump.

"I was very pleased when I saw that Trump endorsed us," said Maples' pro partner Tony Dovolani "Actually it was kinda like, 'Go Marla!'"

"Fuller House" star Jodie Sweetin and her pro partner, Keo Motsepe, revealed they have a code word for when "everything is falling apart."

"Bob-bob," Sweetin said of the dancing pair's new word.

UFC champ Paige Vanzant predicts viewers will be surprised by what they see when she hits the ballroom.

"Everyone sees me as a fighter and identifies me as a tough girl," Vanzant said. "They're gonna see a girly different side of me ... sequins are a little different than MMA gloves."

Nyle DiMarco, winner of the final season of America's Next Top Model, is the first deaf male contestant to compete on Dancing With the Stars.

"It's a huge platform for me and an audience to help raise awareness for deaf people and their perspective on deaf culture," DiMarco said.

Season 22 of "Dancing with the Stars" premieres tonight at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
