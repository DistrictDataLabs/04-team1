Story highlights Obama arrives in Cuba Sunday to begin historic two-day visit

"Although we might have profound differences, we have many values we share," says top Cuban diplomat

Obama is scheduled to meet with Cuban President Raul Castro and anti-government dissidents

Havana, Cuba (CNN) Cuba's top negotiator with the United States welcomed the arrival of U.S. President Barack Obama to the island on Sunday and said officials there would listen with "respect" to any criticisms of the communist-run government.

"We are neighbors. Although we might have profound differences, we have many values we share," said Josefina Vidal, the general director of U.S. affairs at Cuba's Foreign Ministry.

"Your model isn't perfect. Ours isn't," she said. "But it's up to our decisions to make our model more perfect. We can speak openly, without the 'You will change us or I will change you.'"

Obama will arrive via Air Force One on Sunday afternoon at Havana's Jose Mart International Airport to begin an intense and historic two-day visit to the island that includes meetings with Cuban President Raul Castro and anti-government dissidents.

During the visit, Obama will tour the colonial streets of Old Havana, meet with Cuban small-business owners and watch a baseball game between the Tampa Bay Rays and Cuba's national team.
