Star college player Ben Simmons told ESPN that he will indeed declare for the NBA draft. The 6-foot-10 LSU freshman averaged 19.2 points, 11.8 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game this past season for the Tigers but failed to be productive away from the rim.

The lack of a reliable jump shot hasnt stopped Simmons from being the consensus No. 1 overall pick. And thats why it makes financial sense for Simmons to be a one-and-done player at the college level. By declaring this season right as the NBAs salary cap hits an historic spike, he almost doubles the amount of money he could make over the next five years.

For example, in year one, the rookie wage scale for the 2016-17 season is set at $4.9 million, but teams can pay 120 percent over that amount, giving Simmons $5.9 million for his first year if hes the No. 1 pick. His second year salary would be $6.17 million and $6.43 million for Year 3. You also have to assume any team drafting him would pick up his fourth-year option, projected to be almost $8 million, giving him a total of $26.5 million over his first four seasons. If he waited to declare until the 2017-18 season, his first four years would total $27.5 million in compensation. But that extra year costs him more than just $1 million, because he would be able to sign a max deal in Year 5.

This season, a player with 0 to 7 years of service could sign a $16.4 million contract. But thats based on a salary cap of $70 million, or 23.4 percent of a teams maximum spending allowance.

Max salaries for 2015-16, based on years of service:

0-6 yrs: $16.407 mil

7-10 yrs: $19.689 mil

10+ yrs: $22.970 mil  Howard Beck (@HowardBeck) July 9, 2015

New television contracts are expected to drive the salary cap much higher, with the 2020-21 cap, the year Simmons could sign his first maximum deal, projected to be $104 million. That means his max deal would be worth $24.3 million, making his total five-year compensation $50.9 million.

Were he to have waited until after his sophomore season to declare, he could have been eligible for a max contract following the 2021 season. This way, he gets an extra year jump on that big spike.
