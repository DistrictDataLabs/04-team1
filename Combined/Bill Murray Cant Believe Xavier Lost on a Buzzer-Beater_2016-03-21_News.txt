With the Second Round of March Madness coming to a close on Sunday night, the college basketball gods saved some of the most thrilling action for the final games. One instance would certainly be the Wisconsin Badgers beating the Xavier Musketeers on a buzzer-beating Bronson Koenig three. However, not everyone was thrilled about that, especially Xavier fan and legendary actor Bill Murray.

Murray, whose son is on the Xavier coaching staff, was in the crowd after the unreal win for Wisconsin and, well, his reaction was having no reaction at all. Koenigs three left Bill Murray frozen in time, stunned and staring off into the distance trying to rediscover the meaning of life:

This is a tough loss for any Xavier fan to handle, but Murray seems to be taking it especially hard. Just look around him; there are people in tears wailing over the shot. There are people in disgust. And then you have Bill Murray front-and-center who is just completely despondent like hes come face to face with the worst kind of reality.

You know when the Dalai Lama told Bill Murrays character (Carl) in Caddyshack that hed have total clarity when he died? Well I think Murray mightve just died inside and this definitely wasnt the kind of harrowing clarity that he was expecting.

Heres to hoping that Bill Murray recovers from this Xavier loss. And if not, we can all blame Bronson Koenig for the crime.
