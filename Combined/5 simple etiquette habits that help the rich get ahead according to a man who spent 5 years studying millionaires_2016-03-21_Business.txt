Manners matter.

"You have to know how to act and how to do certain things when you're around people," writes Thomas C. Corley in his upcoming book "Change Your Habits, Change Your Life." "Self-made millionaires have mastered certain rules of etiquette that help them in social settings."

Corley would know  he spent five years researching the daily habits of 177 self-made millionaires and segmenting out what he calls "rich habits" and "poverty habits."

Will mastering these etiquette habits guarantee a fortune? Of course not. But it certainly won't hurt.
