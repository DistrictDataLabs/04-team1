Is there room for another Marvel superhero series on Netflix?

Avengers actor Jeremy Renner said he would be open to portraying his Hawkeye character in a Netflix original during an appearance at the first annual Silicon Valley Comic Con in San Francisco, Saturday.

People have been talking about that, said Renner. Ive thought about that in my head like, Oh, if theres ever a way to really explore the character [Hawkeye], maybe its in that world. I dont know.

Before the crowd became too riled at the idea of a possible series, Renner tapered expectations.

Again, these are kind of  things are out of my control. So I dont really  Ive gotta focus on other things in life, he continued.

Still, that doesnt mean hes not interested.

Id definitely be open to it because I really started to enjoy exploring the character more as of recently, Renner said. "So, yeah, the Netflix model I think is a really fantastic way to  thats where all the character drama kind of goes now. Its either youre doing a superhero movie or you kind of go to a Netflix sort of model, HBO, or  thats where all the big television is, right? So, Im always open to something like that. I dont get to say yes or no to those things.

Later, during the same panel, a fan asked Renner if we would be open to doing a Hawkeye and Black Widow movie with costar Scarlett Johansson. Renner didnt hesitate in his response.

In two seconds Id do that, Renner told the crowd.

Will we see either of these come to fruition? Time will tell.

Renners next appearance as Hawkeye will be in Aprils Captain America: Civil War.
