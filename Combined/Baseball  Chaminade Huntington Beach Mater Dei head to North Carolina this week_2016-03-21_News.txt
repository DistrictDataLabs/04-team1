Chaminade, Huntington Beach and Santa Ana Mater Dei will represent Southern California this week in the National High School Invitational in Cary, N.C.

Baseball action begins on Wednesday. Chaminade plays Florida Flanagan at noon (ET). Huntington Beach faces New York Poly Prep at 2 p.m. (ET). Mater Dei takes on Florida The First Academy at 5 p.m. (ET).

Chaminade made it through last week winning two of three Mission League games from Harvard-Westlake. It has USA baseball alum Blake Rutherford, who can give his teammates a tour around the facilities. Huntington Beach, which started the year as the No. 1 team in Southern California, is 3-4 and has lost one of its best players, Logan Pouelsen, for the season after Tommy John surgery. Mater Dei is coming off an impressive win over Cypress.

The tournament lasts through Saturday.
