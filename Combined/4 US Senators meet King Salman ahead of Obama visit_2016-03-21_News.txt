RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP)  Saudi Arabia's official news agency says King Salman has met with a U.S. Congressional delegation ahead of President Barack Obama's scheduled visit next month.

The Saudi Press Agency says the delegation was led by ranking Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Ben Cardin, D-M.D., and included Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon.

SPA says Saudi Crown Prince and Interior Minister Mohammed bin Nayef and Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir also attended Monday's meeting.

On Sunday, the senators met in Doha with Qatar's ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani.

Obama is due to visit Saudi Arabia on April 21 and attend a Gulf Cooperation Council summit. The GCC includes Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman.
