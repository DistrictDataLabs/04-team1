Tucker Max is an author who pioneered the genre known as fratire, an irreverent, tongue-in-cheek description of his testosterone and beer-fueled exploits that gained a decent following about a decade ago. Now CEO of Bookinabox.com, Max has hung up the "assholes finish first" way of thinking for more of a Buddhist lifestyle and philosophy.

From a mixed martial arts octagon, Max talks in this video with Entrepreneur Network partner Joe De Sena, founder and CEO of Reebok Spartan Race and the voice of the Spartan UP! podcast, about what he's learned about business and art from his physical training.

"The first Brazilian jiu-jitsu class I took, my instructor told me -- 'Don't get nervous, don't get afraid, there's no losing in here. In training, there's only winning and learning -- the only way to lose is to not train."

Other takeaways from the video include:

Theres no reason to worry about losing.

Great mentors shorten the learning curve and speed the way to mastery. Take the effort to find one.

If you want something, make sure you have something to offer first.
